      <t>In many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, direct discovery of resources is not
      practical due to sleeping nodes or networks where multicast traffic
is inefficient. These problems can be solved by employing an entity called
a Resource Directory (RD), which contains information about resources held on
other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources. The input to an RD is composed of links, and the output is composed of links constructed from the information stored in the RD. This
document specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, look up,
and remove information on resources. Furthermore, new target attributes useful

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>In the work on Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE), a Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture
suitable for constrained nodes (e.g., with limited RAM and ROM <xref target="RFC7228" format="default"/>)
and networks (e.g., IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) <xref target="RFC4944" format="default"/>)
has been established and is used in
Internet of Things (IoT) or
machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, such as smart energy
and building automation.</t>
      <t>The discovery of resources offered by a constrained server is very important
in machine-to-machine applications where there are no humans in the loop and
static interfaces result in fragility. The discovery of resources provided by
an HTTP web server is typically called web linking <xref target="RFC8288" format="default"/>. The use of
web linking for the description and discovery of resources hosted by
constrained web servers is specified by the CoRE Link Format
<xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>. However, <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> only describes how to discover
resources from the web server that hosts them by querying
<tt>/.well-known/core</tt>. In many constrained scenarios, direct discovery of resources is
not practical due to sleeping nodes or networks where
multicast traffic is inefficient. These problems can be solved by employing
an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains information about resources held on
other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources.</t>
      <t>This document specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, look up,
and remove information on resources. Furthermore, new target attributes useful in
conjunction with an RD are defined. Although the examples in
this document show the use of these interfaces with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252" format="default"/>, they
can be applied in an equivalent manner to HTTP <xref target="RFC7230" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms and
concepts that are discussed in <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8288" format="default"/>, and <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>. Readers should
also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed in <xref target="RFC7252" format="default"/>.  To
describe the REST interfaces defined in this specification, the URI Template
format is used <xref target="RFC6570" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>This specification makes use of the following additional terminology:</t>
      <dl newline="true">
	<dt>Resolve Against</dt>
        <dd>The expression "a URI reference is <em>resolved against</em> a base URI" is used
	to describe the process of <xref target="RFC3986" section="5.2" sectionFormat="comma"/>.
	      Noteworthy corner cases include the following: (1) if the URI reference is a (full)
      URI, resolving against any base URI gives the original
      full URI and (2) resolving an empty URI reference gives the base

          that registers resources to the RD. An endpoint is identified by its
          endpoint name, which is included during registration, and has a
          unique name within the associated sector of the registration.</t>

        <t>The RD is primarily a tool to make discovery operations more
efficient than querying <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> on all connected devices or across
boundaries that would limit those operations.</t>
        <t>It provides information about resources hosted by other devices that could otherwise only be obtained by
directly querying the <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> resource on these other devices, either by a unicast request or a multicast request.</t>
        <t>Information <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only be stored in the RD
if it can be obtained by querying the described device's
<tt>/.well-known/core</tt> resource directly.</t>
        <t>Data in the RD can only be provided by the
device that hosts the data or a dedicated Commissioning Tool (CT).
These CTs act on behalf of endpoints too constrained, or generally
unable, to present that information themselves. No other client can modify data
in the RD. Changes to the information in the RD do not propagate automatically back to the web servers from where the information originated.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="architecture" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Architecture</name>
        <t>The RD architecture is illustrated in <xref target="fig-arch" format="default"/>. An
RD is used as a repository of registrations
describing resources hosted on other web servers, also called endpoints
(EPs).
An endpoint is a web server associated with a scheme, IP address, and port. A physical node may host one or more endpoints. The
RD implements a set of REST interfaces for endpoints to register and maintain
RD registrations and for endpoints to
look up resources from the RD. An RD can be logically segmented by the use of sectors.</t>
        <t>A mechanism to discover an RD using CoRE Link Format <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> is defined.</t>
        <t>Registrations in the RD are soft state and need to be periodically refreshed.</t>
        <t>An endpoint uses specific interfaces to register, update, and remove a registration. It is also possible for an RD to fetch web links
from endpoints and add their contents to its registrations.</t>
        <t>At the first registration of an endpoint, a "registration resource" is created,
the location of which is returned to the registering endpoint. The registering
endpoint uses this registration resource to manage the contents of registrations.</t>
        <t>A lookup interface for discovering any of the web links stored in the RD is
provided using the CoRE Link Format.</t>

        <t>A registrant-EP <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> keep concurrent registrations to more than one RD at the same time
if explicitly configured to do so,
but that is not expected to be supported by typical EP implementations.
Any such registrations are independent of each other.
The usual expectation when multiple discovery mechanisms or addresses are configured
is that they constitute a fall-back path for a single registration.</t>

        <t>The Entity-Relationship (ER) models shown in Figures <xref target="fig-ER-WKC" format="counter"/> and <xref target="fig-ER-RD" format="counter"/> model the contents of <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> and the RD respectively, with entity-relationship diagrams <xref target="ER" format="default"/>. Entities (rectangles) are used for concepts that exist independently. Attributes (ovals) are used for concepts that exist only in connection with a related entity.

        <t>Some of the attribute values are URIs. Those values are always full URIs and never relative references in the information model.
However, they can be expressed as relative references in serializations, and they often are.</t>
        <t>These models provide an abstract view of the information expressed in link-format documents and an RD. They cover the concepts but not necessarily all details of an RD's operation; they are meant to give an overview and not be a template for implementations.</t>

	<t>The web server is free to choose links it deems appropriate to be exposed in its <tt>/.well-known/core</tt>.

        <t><xref target="fig-ER-RD" format="default"/> models the contents of
	the RD, which contains, in addition to <tt>/.well-known/core</tt>, 0 to n registrations of
	endpoints.</t>
        <t>A registration is associated with one endpoint. A registration defines a set of links,
	as defined for <tt>/.well-known/core</tt>. A registration has six types of attributes:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>an endpoint name ("ep", a Unicode string) unique within a sector</li>
          <li>a registration base URI ("base", a URI typically describing the scheme://authority part)</li>
          <li>a lifetime ("lt")</li>
          <li>a registration resource location inside the RD ("href")</li>
          <li>optionally, a sector ("d", a Unicode string)</li>
          <li>optional additional endpoint attributes (from <xref target="iana-registry" format="default"/>)</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The cardinality of "base" is currently 1;
future documents are invited to extend the RD specification to support multiple values (e.g., <xref target="I-D.silverajan-core-coap-protocol-negotiation" format="default"/>).
Its value is used as a base URI when resolving URIs in the links contained in the endpoint.</t>
        <t>Links are modeled as they are in <xref target="fig-ER-WKC" format="default"/>.</t>

        <name>Link-Local Addresses and Zone Identifiers</name>
        <t>Registration base URIs can contain link-local IP addresses.
        To be usable across hosts, those cannot be serialized to
        contain zone identifiers (see <xref target="RFC6874"
        section="1" sectionFormat="comma"/>).</t>
        <t>Link-local addresses can only be used on a single link
(therefore, RD servers cannot announce them when queried on a different link),
and lookup clients using them need to keep track of which interface they got them from.</t>
        <t>Therefore, it is advisable in many scenarios
to use addresses with larger scopes, if available.</t>

      <section anchor="cellular" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Use Case: Cellular M2M</name>
        <t>Over the last few years, mobile operators around the world
have focused on development of M2M solutions in order to
expand the business to the new type of users: machines. The
machines are connected directly to a mobile network using an appropriate
embedded wireless interface (GSM/General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA), LTE, ...) or via a gateway providing
short- and wide-range wireless interfaces.
The ambition in such systems is to build them from reusable components.
These speed up development and deployment
and enable shared use of machines across different applications.
One crucial component of such systems
is the discovery of resources (and thus the endpoints they are hosted on) capable of providing required
information at a given time or acting on instructions from the end users.</t>
        <t>Imagine a scenario where endpoints installed on vehicles enable
tracking of the position of these vehicles for fleet management purposes and allow
monitoring of environment parameters. During the boot-up process,
endpoints register with an RD, which is hosted by the
mobile operator or somewhere in the cloud. Periodically, these endpoints
update their registration and may modify resources they offer.</t>
        <t>When endpoints are not always connected, for example, because they enter
a sleep mode, a remote server is usually used to provide proxy access to
the endpoints. Mobile apps or web applications for environment monitoring contact the RD, look up the endpoints capable of providing information about the environment using an appropriate set of link parameters, obtain information on how to contact them (URLs of the proxy server), and then initiate interaction to obtain information that is finally processed, displayed on the screen, and usually stored in a database. Similarly, fleet management systems provide
the appropriate link parameters to the RD to look up for EPs deployed on
the vehicles the application is responsible for.</t>

      <section anchor="automation" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Use Case: Home and Building Automation</name>
        <t>Home and commercial building automation systems can benefit from the use
of IoT web services.  The discovery requirements of these applications are
demanding. Home automation usually relies on run-time discovery to commission
the system, whereas, in building automation, a combination of professional
commissioning and run-time discovery is used. Both home and building automation
involve peer-to-peer interactions between endpoints and involve battery-powered
sleeping devices.
Both can use the common RD infrastructure to establish device interactions efficiently
but can pick security policies suitable for their needs.</t>
        <t>Two phases can be discerned for a network servicing the system: (1) installation and (2) operation. During the operational phase, the network is connected to the Internet with a border router (e.g., a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) <xref target="RFC6775" format="default"/>), and the nodes connected to the network can use the Internet services that are provided by the IP or network administrator. During the installation phase, the network is completely stand-alone, no border router is connected, and the network only supports the IP communication between the connected nodes. The installation phase is usually followed by the operational phase.
As an RD's operations work without hard dependencies on names or addresses,
it can be used for discovery across both phases.</t>

      <section anchor="usecase-catalogues" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Use Case: Link Catalogues</name>
        <t>Resources may be shared through data brokers that have no knowledge beforehand
of who is going to consume the data. An RD can be used to hold
links about resources and services hosted anywhere to make them discoverable
by a general class of applications.</t>
        <t>For example, environmental and weather sensors that generate data for public
consumption may provide data to an intermediary server or broker. Sensor
data are published to the intermediary upon changes or at regular intervals.
Descriptions of the sensors that resolve to links to sensor data may be published
to an RD. Applications wishing to consume the data can use
RD lookup to discover and resolve links
to the desired resources and endpoints. The RD service need
not be coupled with the data intermediary service. Mapping of RDs
to data intermediaries may be many-to-many.</t>
        <t>Metadata in web link formats like the one defined in <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>, which may be internally stored as  triples or relation/attribute
pairs providing metadata about resource links, need to be supported by RDs. External catalogues that are
represented in other formats may be converted to common web linking formats for
storage and access by RDs. Since it is common practice for these
to be encoded in URNs <xref target="RFC8141" format="default"/>, simple and lossless structural transforms should
generally be sufficient to store external metadata in RDs.</t>
        <t>The additional features of an RD allow sectors to be defined
to enable access to a particular set of resources from particular applications.
This provides isolation and protection of sensitive data when needed. Application groups with multicast addresses may be defined to support efficient data transport.</t>

      <name>RD Discovery and Other Interface-Independent Components</name>
      <t>This and the following sections define the required set of REST interfaces between an RD,
endpoints, and lookup clients. Although the examples throughout these sections assume the use of
CoAP <xref target="RFC7252" format="default"/>, these REST interfaces can also be realized using HTTP <xref target="RFC7230" format="default"/>.
The multicast discovery and simple registration operations are exceptions to that,
as they rely on mechanisms unavailable in HTTP.
In all definitions in these sections, both CoAP response codes (with dot notation) and HTTP response codes
(without dot notation) are shown. An RD implementing this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support
the discovery, registration, update, lookup, and removal interfaces.</t>
      <t>All operations on the contents of the RD <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be atomic and idempotent.</t>

      <t>For several operations, interface templates are given in list form;
those describe the operation participants, request codes, URIs, content formats, and outcomes.
Sections of those templates contain normative content about
Interaction, Method, URI Template, and URI Template Variables,
as well as the details of the Success condition.
The additional sections
for options (like Content-Format) and for Failure codes
give typical cases that an implementation of the RD should deal with.
Those serve to illustrate the typical responses
to readers who are not yet familiar with all the details of CoAP-based interfaces;
they do not limit how a server may respond under atypical circumstances.</t>
      <t>REST clients (registrant-EPs and CTs during registration and maintenance, lookup clients, and RD servers during simple registrations)
must be prepared to receive any unsuccessful code and act upon it
according to its definition, options, and/or payload to the best of their capabilities,
falling back to failing the operation if recovery is not possible.
In particular, they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> retry the request upon 5.03 (Service Unavailable; 503 in HTTP)
according to the Max-Age (Retry-After in HTTP) option
and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> fall back to link format when receiving 4.15 (Unsupported Content-Format; 415 in HTTP).</t>
      <t>An RD <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> make the information submitted to it available to further
directories (subject to security policies on link confidentiality)
if it can ensure that a loop does not form.  The protocol used
between directories to ensure loop-free operation is outside the scope of
this document.</t>
      <section anchor="finding_an_rd" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Finding a Resource Directory</name>
        <t>A (re)starting device may want to find one or more RDs
before it can discover their URIs. Dependent on the operational conditions, one or more of the techniques below apply.</t>
        <t>The device may be preconfigured to exercise specific mechanisms for
finding the RD:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>It may be configured with a specific IP address for the RD.  That IP
address may also be an anycast address, allowing the network to
forward RD requests to an RD that is topologically close; each
target network environment in which some of these preconfigured
nodes are to be brought up is then configured with a route for this
anycast address that leads to an appropriate RD.  (Instead of using
an anycast address, a multicast address can also be preconfigured.
The RD servers then need to configure one of their
interfaces with this multicast address.)</li>
          <li>It may be configured with a DNS name for the RD and use DNS to return
the IP address of the RD; it can find a DNS server to perform the lookup using the usual mechanisms for finding DNS servers.</li>
          <li>It may be configured to use a service discovery mechanism, such as
DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD), as outlined in <xref target="rd-using-dnssd" format="default"/>.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>For cases where the device is not specifically configured with a way
to find an RD, the network may want to provide a
suitable default.</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option RDAO (<xref target="rdao" format="default"/>) can do that.</li>
          <li>When DHCP is in use,
this could be provided via a DHCP option (no such option is defined
at the time of writing).</li>
        </ol>
        <t>Finally, if neither the device nor the network offers any specific
configuration, the device may want to employ heuristics to find a
suitable RD.</t>
        <t>The present specification does not fully define these heuristics but
suggests a number of candidates:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>In a 6LoWPAN, just assume the 6LBR can act as an
RD (using the Authoritative Border Router Option (ABRO) to find that <xref target="RFC6775" format="default"/>).
Confirmation can be obtained by sending a unicast to
<tt>coap://[6LBR]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd*</tt>.</li>
<li>In a network that supports multicast well, discover the RD using
a multicast query for <tt>/.well-known/core</tt>, as specified in CoRE Link
Format <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>, and send a Multicast GET to
<tt>coap://[ff0x::fe]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd*</tt>.  RDs within the
multicast scope will answer the query.</li>
        </ol>

	<t>When answering a multicast request directed at a link-local group,
  the RD may want to respond from a routable address;
  this makes it easier for registrants to use one of their own routable addresses for registration.
When source addresses are selected using the mechanism described in <xref target="RFC6724" format="default"/>,
this can be achieved by applying the changes of its Section <xref target="RFC6724" section="10.4" sectionFormat="bare"/>,
picking public addresses in Rule 7 of its Section <xref target="RFC6724" section="5" sectionFormat="bare"/>,
and superseding Rule 8 with preferring the source address's precedence.</t>
        <t>As some of the RD addresses obtained by the methods listed here are
just (more or less educated) guesses, endpoints <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> make use of any
error messages to very strictly rate-limit requests to candidate IP
addresses that don't work out.  For example, an ICMP Destination
Unreachable message (and, in particular, the port unreachable code for
this message) may indicate the lack of a CoAP server on the candidate
host, or a CoAP error response code, such as 4.05 (Method Not Allowed),
may indicate unwillingness of a CoAP server to act as a directory
server.</t>
        <t>The following RD discovery mechanisms are recommended:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>In managed networks with border routers that need stand-alone operation, the RDAO is recommended (e.g., the operational phase described in <xref target="automation" format="default"/>).</li>
          <li>In managed networks without border routers (no Internet services available), the use of a preconfigured anycast address is recommended (e.g., the installation phase described in <xref target="automation" format="default"/>).</li>
          <li>In networks managed using DNS-SD, the use of DNS-SD for discovery, as described in <xref target="rd-using-dnssd" format="default"/>, is recommended.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The use of multicast discovery in mesh networks is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.</t>
        <section anchor="rdao" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Resource Directory Address Option (RDAO)</name>
          <t>The Resource Directory Address Option (RDAO) carries
information about the address of the RD in RAs (Router Advertisements) of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND),
similar to how Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) options <xref target="RFC8106" format="default"/> are sent. This information is
needed when endpoints cannot discover the RD with a link-local
or realm-local scope multicast address, for instance, because the
endpoint and the RD are separated by a
6LBR. In many circumstances, the availability of DHCP cannot be guaranteed
during commissioning of the network either. The presence and the use of the RD is
essential during commissioning.</t>
          <t>It is possible to send multiple RDAOs in one message,

        <name>URI Discovery</name>
        <t>Before an endpoint can make use of an RD, it must first know the RD's address
and port and the URI path information for its REST APIs. This section defines
discovery of the RD and its URIs using the well-known interface of the
CoRE Link Format <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> after having discovered a host, as described in <xref target="finding_an_rd" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>Discovery of the RD registration URI is performed by sending either a multicast or
unicast GET request to <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> and including a resource type (rt)
parameter <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> with the value "core.rd" in the query string. Likewise, a
resource type parameter value of "core.rd-lookup*" is used to discover the
URIs for RD lookup operations, and core.rd* is used to discover all URIs for RD operations.
Upon success, the response will contain a payload with
a link format entry for each RD function discovered, indicating the URI
of the RD function returned and the corresponding resource type. When performing
multicast discovery, the multicast IP address used will depend on the scope required
and the multicast capabilities of the network (see <xref target="mc-registration" format="default"/>).</t>
        <t>An RD <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide hints about the content formats it supports in the links it exposes or registers, using the "ct" target attribute, as shown in the example below. Clients <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use these hints to select alternate content formats for interaction with the RD.</t>
        <t>HTTP does not support multicast, and, consequently, only unicast discovery can be
	supported using the HTTP <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> resource.</t>
        <t>RDs implementing this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support query filtering for
the rt parameter, as defined in <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>While the link targets in this discovery step are often expressed in path-absolute form,
this is not a requirement.
Clients of the RD <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> therefore accept URIs of all schemes they support,
both as URIs and relative references,
and not limit the set of discovered URIs to those hosted at the address used for URI discovery.</t>
        <t>With security policies where the client requires the RD to be authorized to act as an RD,
that authorization may be limited to resources on which the authorized RD advertises the adequate resource types.
Clients that have obtained links they cannot rely on yet
can repeat the "URI discovery" step at the <tt>/.well-known/core resource</tt> of the indicated host
to obtain the resource type information from an authorized source.</t>
        <t>The URI discovery operation can yield multiple URIs of a given resource type.
The client of the RD can try out any of the discovered addresses.</t>
        <t>The discovery request interface is specified as follows
(this is exactly the well-known interface of <xref target="RFC6690" section="4" sectionFormat="comma"/>,

      <t>After discovering the location of an RD, a registrant-EP or CT <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
register the resources of the registrant-EP using the registration interface. This interface
accepts a POST from an endpoint containing the list of resources to be added
to the directory as the message payload in the CoRE Link Format <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> or other representations of web links, along with query
parameters indicating the name of the endpoint and, optionally, the sector,
lifetime, and base URI of the registration.
It is expected that other specifications will define further parameters (see
<xref target="iana-registry" format="default"/>). The RD then creates a new registration resource in the RD and returns its location. The receiving endpoint <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use that
location when refreshing registrations using this interface. Registration
resources in the RD are kept active for the period indicated by the lifetime
parameter. The creating endpoint is responsible for refreshing the registration resource within this
period, using either the registration or update interface. The registration
interface <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be implemented to be idempotent, so that registering twice
with the same endpoint parameters ep and d (sector) does not create multiple registration resources.</t>
      <t>The following rules apply for a registration request targeting a given (ep, d) value pair:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>When the (ep, d) value pair of the registration request is different from any existing registration,
a new registration is generated.</li>
        <li>When the (ep, d) value pair of the registration request is equal to an existing registration,
the content and parameters of the existing registration are replaced with the content of the registration request.
As with changes to registration resources, security policies (<xref target="policies" format="default"/>) usually require such requests to come from the same device.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The posted link-format document can (and typically does) contain relative references
both in its link targets and in its anchors; it can also contain empty anchors.
The RD server needs to resolve these references in order to faithfully represent them in lookups.
They are resolved against the base URI of the registration,
which is provided either explicitly in the <tt>base</tt> parameter or constructed implicitly from the requester's URI, as constructed from its network address and scheme.</t>
      <t>For media types to which <xref target="limitedlinkformat" format="default"/> applies
(i.e., documents in <tt>application/link-format</tt>),
request bodies <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be expressed in Limited Link Format.</t>

	    <dt>ep :=</dt>
            
            <dd><t>Endpoint name (mostly mandatory). The endpoint name is an identifier
	    that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique within a sector.</t>
	    
            <t>As the endpoint name is a Unicode string, it is
            encoded in UTF-8 (and possibly percent-encoded) during
            variable expansion (see <xref target="RFC6570" section="3.2.1"
            sectionFormat="comma"/>).  The endpoint name <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> contain any
	    character in the inclusive ranges 0-31 or 127-159.</t>
	    
            <t>The maximum length of this parameter is 63 bytes encoded in UTF-8.</t>
            <t>If the RD is configured to recognize the endpoint that is to be authorized to use
	    exactly
	    one endpoint name, the RD assigns that name. In that case, giving the endpoint name
	    becomes optional for the client; if the client gives any other endpoint name, it is
	    not authorized to perform the registration.</t>
            </dd>
	    
	    <dt>d :=</dt>
            <dd><t>Sector (optional). This is the sector to which this endpoint belongs.
	    When this parameter is not present, the
	    RD <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> associate the endpoint with a configured default sector
	    (possibly based on the endpoint's authorization)
	    or leave it empty.</t>
	    <t>The sector is encoded like the ep parameter and is limited to 63 bytes encoded in

            </dd>
	    
	    <dt>lt := </dt>
	    <dd>Lifetime (optional). This is the lifetime of the registration in seconds, with a

	    If no lifetime is included in the initial registration, a default value of
	    90000 (25 hours) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be assumed.</dd>
	    <dt>base :=</dt>
	    <dd>
	      <t>Base URI (optional). This parameter sets the base URI of the registration, under
	      which the relative links in the payload are to be interpreted. The specified URI
	      typically does not have a path component of its own and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
	      suitable as a base URI to resolve any relative references given in the registration.
	      The parameter is therefore usually of the shape "scheme://authority" for
	      HTTP and CoAP URIs.
	      The URI <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> have a query or fragment component,
	      as any non-empty relative part in a reference would remove those parts from the
	      resulting URI.</t>
	      <t>In the absence of this parameter, the scheme of the protocol, the source address,
	      and the source port of the registration request are assumed.
	      The base URI is consecutively constructed by concatenating the used protocol's scheme
	      with the characters "://", the requester's source address as an address literal,
	      and ":" followed by its port (if it was not the protocol's default
	      one). This is analogous to the process described in <xref target="RFC7252" section="6.5" sectionFormat="comma"/>.</t>
	      <t>This parameter is
	      mandatory when the directory is filled by a third party, such as a
	      commissioning tool.</t>
              <t>If the registrant-EP uses an ephemeral port to register with, it
	      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the base
	      parameter in the registration to provide a valid network path.</t>
              <t>A registrant that cannot be reached by potential lookup clients at the address it
	      registers from
	      (e.g., because it is behind some form of Network Address Translation (NAT))
	      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide a reachable base address with its registration.</t>
              <t>If the base URI contains a link-local IP literal, it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
	      contain a Zone Identifier
	      and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be local to the link on which the registration request is
	      received.</t>
              <t>Endpoints that register with a base that contains a path component
	      cannot efficiently express their registrations in Limited Link Format (<xref
	      target="limitedlinkformat" format="default"/>).
	      Those applications should use different representations of links to which <xref

	      (e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coral" format="default"/>). </t>

             <dt>extra-attrs :=</dt>
	      <dd>Additional registration attributes (optional). The endpoint can pass any

	    <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be a stable identifier generated by the RD, as it is used
	    for all subsequent operations on this registration resource. The registration
	    resource location thus returned is for the purpose of updating the lifetime
	    of the registration and for maintaining the content of the
	    registered links, including updating and deleting links.</t>
	    <t>A registration with an already-registered ep and d value pair
	    responds with the same success code and location as the original registration;
	    the set of links registered with the endpoint is replaced with the links
	    from the payload.</t>
	    <t>The location <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have a query or fragment component,
	    as that could conflict with query parameters during the registration update
	    operation. Therefore, the Location-Query option <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
	    present in a successful response.</t>
              </dd>
	    </dl>
	    
	    <t>If the registration fails, including request timeouts,
	    or if delays from Service Unavailable responses with Max-Age or Retry-After
	    accumulate to exceed the registrant's configured timeouts,
	    it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> pick another registration URI from the "URI discovery" step of <xref target="discovery"/>,
	    and, if there is only one or the list is exhausted,
	    pick other choices from the "finding a  resource directory" step of <xref target="finding_an_rd"/>.
	    Care has to be taken to consider the freshness of results obtained earlier,
	    e.g., the result of a <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> response,
	    the lifetime of an RDAO, and DNS responses.
	    Any rate limits and persistent errors from the "finding a resource directory" step
	    must be considered for the whole registration time,
	    not only for a single operation.</t>
	    <t>The following example shows a registrant-EP with the name "node1" registering

        <t>This approach requires that the registrant-EP makes available the hosted resources

Constrained devices <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> regard the initial request as temporarily failed when they need RAM occupied by their own request to serve the RD's GET

registration with an RD. To use the interface, the registering endpoint sends a POST request to the registration resource returned by the initial registration operation.</t>
          <t>An update <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> update registration parameters like lifetime, base URI, or others.
Parameters that are not being changed should not
be included in an update. Adding parameters that have not changed increases
the size of the message but does not have any other implications.
Parameters are included as query parameters in an update operation, as
in <xref target="registration" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>A registration update resets the timeout of the registration to the (possibly
updated) lifetime of the registration, independent of whether an <tt>lt</tt> parameter
was given.</t>
          <t>If the base URI of the registration is changed in an update,
relative references submitted in the original registration or later updates are resolved anew against the new base.</t>
          <t>The registration update operation only describes the use of POST with an empty payload.
Future standards might describe the semantics of using content formats and payloads
with the POST method to update the links of a registration (see <xref target="link-up" format="default"/>).</t>
          <t>The update registration request interface is specified as follows:</t>
          <dl>
            <dt>Interaction:</dt>
            <dd>EP or CT -&gt; RD</dd>

	      <t><br/></t>
              <dl>

                <dd>This is the location returned by the RD as a result of a successful
		earlier registration.</dd>
                <dt>lt :=</dt>
                <dd>Lifetime (optional). This is the lifetime of the registration in seconds,
		with a range of 1-4294967295. If no lifetime is included, the previous last
		lifetime set on a previous update or the original registration
		(falling back to 90000) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used.</dd>
                <dt>base :=</dt>
                <dd>
                  <t>Base URI (optional). This parameter updates the base URI established in the
		  original registration to a new value and is subject to
		  the same restrictions as in the registration.</t>
                  <t>If the parameter is set in an update, it is stored by the RD as the new
		  base URI under which to interpret the relative links present in the payload of
		  the original registration.</t>
                  <t>If the parameter is not set in the request but was set before, the previous
		  base URI value is kept unmodified.</t>
                  <t>If the parameter is not set in the request and was not set before either, the
		  source address and source port of the update request are stored as the
		  base URI.</t>
                </dd>
                <dt>extra-attrs :=</dt>
                <dd>
                  <t>Additional registration attributes (optional). As with the registration,
		  the RD processes them if it knows their semantics. Otherwise, unknown
		  attributes are stored as endpoint attributes, overriding any previously
		  stored endpoint attributes of the same key.</t>
		  <t>Note that this default behavior does not allow removing an endpoint attribute
		  in an update. For attributes whose functionality depends on the endpoints'
		  ability to remove them in an update,
		  it can make sense to define a value whose presence is equivalent to the absence
		  of a value. As an alternative, an extension can define different updating rules
		  for their attributes. That necessitates either discovering whether the RD is
		  aware of that extension or tolerating the default behavior.</t></dd>

          <t>An RD <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> determine a request's freshness
and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the Echo option if it requires request freshness and cannot determine it in any other way.
An endpoint <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support the use of the Echo option.

            <t>Some simple mechanisms the RD can employ are:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
		<t>State counter. The RD can keep a monotonous counter that increments
		whenever a registration changes. For every registration resource, it stores

		them need to have at least that value encoded in their Echo option
		and are otherwise rejected with a 4.01 (Unauthorized) and the current
		counter value as the Echo value. If other applications on the same server
		use Echo as well, that encoding may include a prefix indicating that it
		pertains to the RD's counter.</t>
                <t>The value associated with a resource needs to be kept across the removal

                <t>Preemptive Echo values. The current state counter can be sent in an Echo
		option not only when requests are rejected with 4.01 (Unauthorized) but
		also with successful responses. Thus, clients can be provided with Echo
		values sufficient for their next request on a regular basis. This is also described in <xref target="RFC9175" section="2.3" sectionFormat="of"/> </t>
                <t> While endpoints may discard received Echo values at leisure between

      <t>To discover the resources registered with the RD,

to return resource descriptions in alternative formats (e.g., JSON or CBOR link format <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-links-json" format="default"/>)
or use more advanced interfaces (e.g., supporting context- or semantic-based lookup) on different resources that are discovered independently.</t>
      <t>RD lookup allows lookups for endpoints and resources
using attributes defined in this document and for use with the CoRE

        <t>Resource lookup results in links that are semantically equivalent to the links submitted to the RD by the registrant.
The links and link parameters returned by the lookup are equal to the originally submitted ones,
except that the target reference is fully resolved

        <t>Links that did not have an anchor attribute in the registration are returned without an anchor attribute.

        <t>If the base URI of a registration contains a link-local address,
the RD <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> show its links unless the lookup was made from the

        <t>Using the Accept option, the requester can control whether the returned list is returned in CoRE Link Format (<tt>application/link-format</tt>, default) or in alternate content formats (e.g., from <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-links-json" format="default"/>).</t>
        <t>Multiple search criteria <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be included in a lookup. All included criteria <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> match for a link to be returned. The RD <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support matching with multiple search criteria.</t>

	<t>A link matches a search criterion if it has an attribute of
        the same name and the same value, allowing for a trailing "*"
        wildcard operator, as in <xref target="RFC6690" section="4.1"
        sectionFormat="of"/>.  Attributes that are defined as
        <tt>relation-types</tt> (in the link-format ABNF) match if the
        search value matches any of their values (see <xref target="RFC6690" section="4.1" sectionFormat="of"/>;
        for example, <tt>?if=tag:example.net,2020:sensor</tt> matches
        <tt>;if="example.regname tag:example.net,2020:sensor";</tt>.
        A resource link also matches a search criterion if its
        endpoint would match the criterion, and vice versa, an
        endpoint link matches a search criterion if any of its
        resource links matches it.</t>
        <t>Note that <tt>href</tt> is a valid search criterion and matches target references. Like all search criteria, on a resource lookup, it can match the target reference of the resource link itself but also the registration resource of the endpoint that registered it.
Queries for resource link targets <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be in URI form (i.e., not relative references) and are matched against a resolved link target. Queries for endpoints <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be expressed in path-absolute form if possible and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be expressed in URI form otherwise; the RD <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> recognize either.
The <tt>anchor</tt> attribute is usable for resource lookups and, if queried, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be in URI form as well.</t>
        <t>Additional query parameters "page" and "count" are used to obtain lookup results in specified increments using pagination, where count specifies how many links to return and page specifies which subset of links organized in sequential pages, each containing 'count' links, starting with link zero and page zero. Thus, specifying a count of 10 and page of 0 will return the first 10 links in the result set (links 0-9). Specifying a count of 10 and page of 1 will return the next 'page' containing links 10-19, and so on.
Unlike block-wise transfer of a complete result set,
these parameters ensure that each chunk of results can be interpreted on its own.
This simplifies the processing
but can result in duplicate or missed items when coinciding with changes from the registration interface.</t>
        <t>Endpoints that are interested in a lookup result repeatedly or continuously can use
mechanisms like ETag caching, resource observation <xref target="RFC7641" format="default"/>,
or any future mechanism that might allow more efficient observations of collections.
These are advertised, detected, and used according to their own specifications
and can be used with the lookup interface as with any other resource.</t>
        <t>When resource observation is used,
every time the set of matching links changes or the content of a matching link changes, the RD sends a notification with the matching link set.
The notification contains the successful current response to the given request,
especially with respect to representing zero matching links
(see "Success" item below).</t>

    <section anchor="policies" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Security Policies</name>
      <t>The security policies that are applicable to an RD strongly depend on the application
and are not set out normatively here.</t>
      <t>This section provides a list of aspects that applications should consider when describing their use of the RD,
without claiming to cover all cases.
It uses terminology of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" format="default"/>,
in which the RD acts as the Resource Server (RS), and both registrant-EPs and lookup clients act as Clients (C) with support from an Authorization Server (AS),
without the intention of ruling out other schemes (e.g., those based on certificates/Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs)).</t>
      <t>Any, all, or none of the below can apply to an application.
Which are relevant depends on its protection objectives.</t>
      <t>Security policies are set by configuration of the RD or by choice of the implementation.
Lookup clients (and, where relevant, endpoints) can only trust an RD to uphold them if it is authenticated
and authorized to serve as an RD according to the application's requirements.</t>
      <section anchor="secure-ep" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Endpoint Name</name>
        <t>Whenever an RD needs to provide trustworthy results to clients doing endpoint lookup
or resource lookup with filtering on the endpoint name,
the RD must ensure that the registrant is authorized to use the given endpoint name.
This applies both to registration and later to operations on the registration resource.
It is immaterial whether the client is the registrant-EP itself or a CT is doing the registration.
The RD cannot tell the difference, and CTs may use authorization credentials authorizing only operations on that particular endpoint name or a wider range of endpoint names.</t>
        <t>It is up to the concrete security policy to describe
how the endpoint name and sector are transported when certificates are used.
For example, it may describe how SubjectAltName dNSName entries are mapped to endpoint and domain names.</t>
        <section anchor="arbitrary-ep" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Random Endpoint Names</name>
          <t>Conversely, in applications where the RD does not check the endpoint name,
the authorized registering endpoint can generate a random number (or string) that identifies the endpoint.
The RD should then remember unique properties of the registrant,
associate them with the registration for as long as its registration resource is active (which may be longer than the registration's lifetime),
and require the same properties for operations on the registration resource.</t>

<t>Registrants that are prepared to pick a different identifier when their initial attempt
(or attempts, in the unlikely case of two subsequent collisions)
at registration is unauthorized should pick an identifier at least twice as long as the expected number of registrants;
registrants without any such recovery options should pick significantly longer endpoint names (e.g., using Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URNs <xref target="RFC4122" format="default"/>).</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="entered-links" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Entered Links</name>
        <t>When lookup clients expect that certain types of links can only originate from certain endpoints,
then the RD needs to apply filtering to the links an endpoint may register.</t>
        <t>For example, if clients use an RD to find a server that provides firmware updates,
then any registrant that wants to register (or update) links to firmware sources will need to provide suitable credentials to do so, independently of its endpoint name.</t>
        <t>Note that the impact of having undesirable links in the RD depends on the application.
If the client requires the firmware server to present credentials as a firmware server,
a fraudulent link's impact is limited to the client revealing its intention to obtain updates and slowing down the client until it finds a legitimate firmware server;
if the client accepts any credentials from the server as long as they fit the provided URI, the impact is larger.</t>

<t>An RD may also require that links are only registered if the registrant is authorized to publish information about the anchor (or even target) of the link.
One way to do this is to demand that the registrant present the same credentials in its role as a registering client that it would need to present in its role as a server when contacted at the resources' URI. These credentials may include using the address and port that are part of the URI.
Such a restriction places severe practical limitations on the links that can be registered.</t>
        <t>As above, the impact of undesirable links depends on the extent to which the lookup client relies on the RD.
To avoid the limitations, RD applications should consider prescribing that lookup clients only use the discovered information as hints
and describe which pieces of information need to be verified because they impact the application's security.
A straightforward way to verify such information is to request it again from an authorized server, typically the one that hosts the target resource.
That is similar to what happens in <xref target="discovery" format="default"/> when the "URI discovery" step is repeated.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="link-confidentiality" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Link Confidentiality</name>
        <t>When registrants publish information in the RD that is not available to any client that would query the registrant's <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> interface,
or when lookups to that interface are subject to stricter firewalling than lookups to the RD,
the RD may need to limit which lookup clients may access the information.</t>
        <t>In this case, the endpoint (and not the lookup clients) needs to be careful to check the RD's authorization.
The RD needs to check any lookup client's authorization
before revealing information directly (in resource lookup)
or indirectly (when using it to satisfy a resource lookup search criterion).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="segmentation" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Segmentation</name>
        <t>Within a single RD, different security policies can apply.</t>
        <t>One example of this are multi-tenant deployments separated by the sector (d) parameter.
Some sectors might apply limitations on the endpoint names available,
while others use a random identifier approach to endpoint names and place limits on the entered links based on their attributes instead.</t>
        <t>Care must be taken in such setups to determine the applicable access control measures to each operation.
One easy way to do that is to mandate the use of the sector parameter on all operations,
as no credentials are suitable for operations across sector borders anyway.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="first-come-first-remembered-a-default-policy" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>"First Come First Remembered": A Default Policy</name>
        <t>The "First Come First Remembered" policy is provided both as a reference example for a
	security policy definition and as a policy that implementations may choose to use as
	default policy in the absence of any other configuration. It is designed to enable efficient
	discovery operations even in ad hoc settings.</t>
	<t>Under this policy, the RD accepts registrations for any endpoint name that is not assigned to an active registration resource
and only accepts registration updates from the same endpoint.
The policy is minimal in that it does not make any promises to lookup clients about the claims of Sections <xref target="entered-links" format="counter"/> and <xref target="link-confidentiality" format="counter"/>,
and promises about the claims in <xref target="secure-ep" format="default"/> are limited to the lifetime of that endpoint's registration.
It does however promise the endpoint that, for the duration of its registration, its links will be discoverable on the RD.</t>
        <t>When a registration or operation is attempted, the RD <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> determine the client's subject name or public key:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>If the client's credentials indicate any subject name that is certified by any authority that the RD recognizes (which may be the system's trust anchor store), all such subject names are stored.
With credentials based on CWT or JWT (as common with Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)), the Subject (sub) claim is stored as a single name, if it exists.
With X.509 certificates, the Common Name (CN) and the complete list of SubjectAltName entries are stored.
In both cases, the authority that certified the claim is stored along with the subject, as the latter may only be locally unique.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, if the client proves possession of a private key, the matching public key is stored.
This applies both to raw public keys and to the public keys indicated in certificates that failed the above authority check.</li>
          <li>If neither is present, a reference to the security session itself is stored.
With (D)TLS, that is the connection itself or the session resumption information, if available.
With OSCORE, that is the security context.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>As part of the registration operation, that information is stored along with the registration resource.</t>
        <t>The RD <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> accept all registrations whose registration resource is not already active,
as long as they are made using a security layer supported by the RD.</t>
        <t>Any operation on a registration resource,
including registrations that lead to an existing registration resource,
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be rejected by the RD unless all the stored information is found in the new request's credentials.</t>

<t>Note that, even though subject names are compared in this policy,
they are never directly compared to endpoint names,
and an endpoint cannot expect to "own" any particular endpoint name outside of an active registration --
even if a certificate says so.
It is an accepted shortcoming of this approach that the endpoint has no indication of whether the RD remembers it by its subject name or public key;
recognition by subject happens on a best-effort basis (given the RD may not recognize any authority).
Clients <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to pick a different endpoint name when rejected by the RD initially or after a change in their credentials;
picking an endpoint name, as per <xref target="arbitrary-ep" format="default"/>, is an easy option for that.</t>
        <t>For this policy to be usable without configuration, clients should not set a sector name in their registrations.
An RD can set a default sector name for registrations accepted under this policy,
which is especially useful in a segmented setup where different policies apply to different sectors.
The configuration of such a behavior, as well as any other configuration applicable to such an RD
(i.e., the set of recognized authorities),
is out of scope for this document.</t>

      <t>Access that is limited or affects sensitive data <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be protected,
e.g., using (D)TLS or OSCORE <xref target="RFC8613" format="default"/>;
which aspects of the RD this affects depends on the security policies of the application (see <xref target="policies" format="default"/>).</t>
      <section anchor="seccons-discovery" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Discovery</name>
        <t>Most steps in discovery of the RD, and possibly its resources, are not covered by CoAP's security mechanisms.
This will not endanger the security properties of the registrations and lookup itself
(where the client requires authorization of the RD if it expects any security properties of the operation)
but may leak the client's intention to third parties
and allow them to slow down the process.</t>
        <t>To mitigate that, clients can retain the RD's address,
use secure discovery options like configured addresses,
and send queries for RDs in a very general form (e.g., <tt>?rt=core.rd*</tt> rather than <tt>?rt=core.rd-lookup-ep</tt>).</t>

        <name>Endpoint Identification and Authentication</name>
        <t>An endpoint (name, sector) pair is unique within the set of endpoints registered by the RD. An endpoint <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be identified by its protocol, port, or IP
address, as these may change over the lifetime of an endpoint.</t>
        <t>Every operation performed by an endpoint on an RD
<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be mutually authenticated using a pre-shared key, a raw public key, or
certificate-based security.</t>
        <t>Consider the following threat: two devices, A and B, are registered at a single server. Both devices have unique, per-device credentials for use with DTLS to make sure that only parties with authorization to access A or B can do so.</t>
        <t>Now, imagine that a malicious device A wants to sabotage the device B. It uses its credentials during the DTLS exchange. Then, it specifies the
endpoint name of device B as the name of its own endpoint in device A. If the server does not check
whether the identifier provided in the DTLS handshake matches the
identifier used at the CoAP layer, then it may be inclined to use the
endpoint name for looking up what information to provision to the malicious device.</t>

<t>Endpoint authorization needs to be checked on registration and registration resource operations
independently of whether there are configured requirements on the credentials for a given endpoint name and sector (<xref target="secure-ep" format="default"/>)
or whether arbitrary names are accepted (<xref target="arbitrary-ep" format="default"/>).</t>
        <t>Simple registration could be used to circumvent address-based access control.
An attacker would send a simple registration request with the victim's address as the source address
and later look up the victim's <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> content in the RD.
Mitigation for this is recommended in <xref target="simple" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The registration resource path is visible to any client that is allowed endpoint lookup
and can be extracted by resource lookup clients as well.
The same goes for registration attributes that are shown as target attributes or lookup attributes.
The RD needs to consider this in the choice of registration resource paths
and administrators or endpoint in their choice of attributes.</t>

updates are needed.


b) In Section 9.3, we would like to confirm that this statement is correct. We
ask because we are unsure if the descriptions in the table in this section
fulfill this requirement.

Original:
   The description must give details on whether the parameter can be
   updated, and how it is to be processed in lookups.

        <name>RD Parameters Registry</name>
        <t>This specification defines a new subregistry for registration and
        lookup parameters called "RD Parameters" within the "Constrained
        RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry. Although this
        specification defines a basic set of parameters, it is expected that
        other standards that make use of this interface will define new
        ones.</t>
        <t>Each entry in the registry must include:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>the human-readable name of the parameter,</li>
          <li>the short name, as used in query parameters or target attributes,</li>
          <li>syntax and validity requirements (if any),</li>
          <li>indication of whether it can be passed as a query parameter at registration of
	  endpoints, passed as a query parameter in lookups, or expressed as a target
	  attribute,</li>
          <li>a description, and</li>
          <li>a link to reference documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>The query parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be both a valid URI query key <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/> and a token as used in <xref target="RFC8288" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The reference documentation must give details on whether the parameter can be updated and how it is to be processed in lookups.</t>
        <t>The mechanisms around new RD parameters should be designed in such a way that they tolerate RD implementations that are unaware of the parameter and expose any parameter passed at registration or updates in endpoint lookups. (For example, if a parameter used at registration were to be confidential, the registering endpoint should be instructed to only set that parameter if the RD advertises support for keeping it confidential at the discovery step.)</t>

        <t>The IANA policy for future additions to the subregistry is Expert Review,
as described in <xref target="RFC8126" format="default"/>. The evaluation should consider
formal criteria,
duplication of functionality (i.e., is the new entry redundant with an existing one?),
topical suitability (e.g., is the described property actually a property of the endpoint and not a property of a particular resource, in which case it should go into the payload of the registration and need not be registered?),
and the potential for conflict with commonly used target attributes (e.g., <tt>if</tt> could be used as a parameter for conditional registration if it were not to be used in lookup or attributes but would make a bad parameter for lookup because a resource lookup with an <tt>if</tt> query parameter could ambiguously filter by the registered endpoint property or the target attribute <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>).</t>
        <section anchor="et-description" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Full Description of the "Endpoint Type" RD Parameter</name>
          <t>An endpoint registering at an RD can describe itself with
          endpoint types, similar to how resources are described with resource
          types in <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>.  An endpoint
          type is expressed as a string, which can be either a URI or one of
          the values defined in the "Endpoint Type (et=) RD Parameter Values"
          subregistry.  Endpoint types can be passed in the <tt>et</tt> query
          parameter as part of extra-attrs at the "registration" step of <xref target="registration"/>, are shown
          on endpoint lookups using the <tt>et</tt> target attribute, and can
          be filtered for using <tt>et</tt> as a search criterion in resource
          and endpoint lookup.  Multiple endpoint types are given as separate
          query parameters or link attributes.</t>
          <t>Note that the endpoint type differs from the resource type in that it uses multiple
attributes rather than space-separated values.
As a result, RDs implementing this specification automatically support correct
filtering in the lookup interfaces from the rules for unknown endpoint
attributes.</t>

      <name>Examples</name>
      <t>Two examples are presented: a lighting installation example in <xref target="lt-ex" format="default"/> and a Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) example in <xref target="lwm2m-ex" format="default"/>.</t>
      <section anchor="lt-ex" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Lighting Installation</name>
        <t>This example shows a simplified lighting installation that makes use of
the RD with a CoAP interface to facilitate the installation and startup of
the application code in the lights and sensors. In particular, the example
leads to the definition of a group and the enabling of the corresponding
multicast address, as described in <xref target="groups" format="default"/>. No conclusions must be drawn on the realization of actual
installation or naming procedures, because the example only emphasizes some of the issues
that may influence the use of the RD and does not pretend to be normative.</t>
        <section anchor="lt-in-ch" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Installation Characteristics</name>
          <t>The example assumes that the installation is managed. That means that a Commissioning
Tool (CT) is used to authorize the addition of nodes, name them, and name
their services. The CT can be connected to the installation in many ways:
the CT can be part of the installation network, connected by Wi-Fi to the
installation network, connected via GPRS link, or connected by another method.</t>
          <t>It is assumed that there are two naming authorities for the installation:
(1) the network manager that is responsible for the correct operation of
the network and the connected interfaces and (2) the lighting manager that
is responsible for the correct functioning of networked lights and sensors.
The result is the existence of two naming schemes coming from the two managing
entities.</t>
          <t>The example installation consists of one presence sensor and two luminaries,
luminary1 and luminary2, each with their own wireless interface. Each luminary
contains three lamps: left, right, and middle. Each luminary is accessible
through one endpoint. For each lamp, a resource exists to modify the settings
of a lamp in a luminary. The purpose of the installation is that the presence
sensor notifies the presence of persons to a group of lamps. The group of
lamps consists of the middle and left lamps of luminary1 and the right lamp of luminary2.</t>
          <t>Before commissioning by the lighting manager, the network is installed, and
access to the interfaces is proven to work by the network manager.</t>
          <t>At the moment of installation, the network under installation is not necessarily
connected to the DNS infrastructure. Therefore, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) IPv6 addresses are
assigned to CT, RD, luminaries, and the sensor.
The addresses shown in <xref target="interface-S" format="default"/> below stand in for these in the following examples.</t>

      <name>Groups Registration and Lookup</name>
      <t>The RD-Group's usage pattern allows announcing application groups inside an RD.</t>
      <t>Groups are represented by endpoint registrations.
      Their base address is a multicast address,
      and they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be entered with the endpoint type <tt>core.rd-group</tt>.
      The endpoint name can also be referred to as a group name in this context.</t>
      <t>The registration is inserted into the RD by a Commissioning Tool,
      which might also be known as a group manager here.
      It performs third-party registration and registration updates.</t>
      <t>The links it registers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be available on all members that join the group.
Depending on the application, members that lack some resources
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be permissible if requests to them fail gracefully.</t>
      <t>The following example shows a CT registering a group with the name "lights", which provides two resources.
The directory resource path /rd
is an example RD location discovered in a request similar to <xref target="example-discovery" format="default"/>.
The group address in the example is constructed from the reserved 2001:db8:: prefix in <xref target="RFC3849" format="default"/> as a unicast-prefix-based site-local address (see <xref target="RFC3306" format="default"/>).</t>

      </figure>
      <t>In this example, the group manager can easily permit devices that have no
writable color-temperature to join, as they would still respond to brightness-changing commands. Had the group instead contained a single resource that sets
brightness and color-temperature atomically, endpoints would need to support
both properties.</t>
      <t>The resources of a group can be looked up like any other resource,
and the group registrations (along with any additional registration parameters)
can be looked up using the endpoint lookup interface.</t>

following multicast request to learn about neighbors supporting resources with

          <name>Resolving the URIs</name>
          <t>The client parses the single returned link. Its target (sometimes
called "href") is <tt>/sensors/temp</tt>, which is a relative URI that needs resolving.
The base
URI <tt>coap://[ff02::fd]:5683/.well-known/core</tt> is used to resolve the
reference against <tt>/sensors/temp</tt>.</t>
          <t>The base URI of the requested resource can be composed from the options of the CoAP GET request by following the steps of
<xref target="RFC7252" sectionFormat="comma" section="6.5"/> (with an addition at the end of Section <xref target="RFC7252" sectionFormat="bare" section="8.2"/>) into
<tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/.well-known/core</tt>.</t>
          <t>Because <tt>/sensors/temp</tt> starts with a single slash,
the link's target is resolved by replacing the path <tt>/.well-known/core</tt>
from the base URI (<xref target="RFC3986" sectionFormat="comma" section="5.2"/>) with the relative target URI <tt>/sensors/temp</tt> into

          <t>A relation in a web link is a three-part statement that specifies a named relation between the so-called "context resource"
and the target resource, like "<em>This page</em> has <em>its table
of contents</em> at <em>/toc.html</em>". In link-format documents,
there is an implicit "host relation" specified with default parameter rel="hosts".</t>
          <t>In our example, the context resource of the link is implied to be <tt>coap:://[2001:db8:f0::1]</tt>
by the default value of the anchor (see <xref target="resolution-rules" format="default"/>).
A full English expression of the "host relation" is:</t>
          <t indent="3"><tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]</tt> is hosting the resource
<tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp</tt>, which is of the resource type "temperature" and
can be read in the text/plain content format.</t>

        <t>Parsing the third link, the client encounters the "anchor" parameter. It is
a URI relative to the base URI of the request and is thus resolved to
<tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp</tt>.
That is the context resource of the link, so the "rel" statement is not about
the target and the base URI any more but about the target and the resolved
URI. Thus, the third link could be read as:</t>
<t indent="3"><tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp</tt> has an alternate representation at
<tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/t</tt>.</t>

        <t>The RD would have accepted the registration and queried the
simple host's <tt>/.well-known/core</tt> by itself. As a result, the host is registered
as an endpoint in the RD with the name "simple-host1". The registration is
active for 90000 seconds, and the endpoint registration base URI is
<tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]</tt>, following the resolution steps described in <xref target="resolveURI" format="default"/>. It should be remarked that the base URI constructed that way always yields a URI of the form scheme://authority without path suffix.</t>
        <t>If the client now queries the RD as it would previously have issued a multicast
request, it would go through the RD discovery steps by fetching
<tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::ff]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd-lookup-res</tt>, obtain
<tt>coap://[2001:db8:f0::ff]/rd-lookup/res</tt> as the resource lookup endpoint, and

        <name>A Note on Differences between Link-Format and Link Header Fields</name>
        <t>While link-format and Link header fields look very similar and are based on the same
model of typed links, there are some differences between <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> and
<xref target="RFC8288" format="default"/>.
When implementing an RD or interacting with an RD,
care must be taken to follow the behavior described in <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>
whenever <tt>application/link-format</tt> representations are used.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>"Default value of anchor":
Under both <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC8288" format="default"/>,
relative references in the term inside the angle brackets (the target)
and the anchor attribute are resolved against the relevant base URI
(which usually is the URI used to retrieve the entity)
and independent of each other.  </t>
            <t>
When, in a Link header <xref target="RFC8288" format="default"/>, the anchor attribute is absent,
the link's context is the URI of the selected representation
(and usually equal to the base URI).  </t>
            <t>
In links per <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>, if the anchor attribute is absent,
the default value is the Origin of
(for all relevant cases, the URI reference <tt>/</tt> resolved against)
the link's target.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>There is no percent encoding in link-format documents.  </t>
            <t>A link-format document is a UTF-8-encoded string of Unicode characters and
	    does not have percent encoding, while Link header fields are practically ASCII
	    strings that use percent encoding for non-ASCII characters, stating the
	    encoding explicitly when required.  </t>
	    <t>For example, while a Link header field in a page about a Swedish city might
	    read:</t>

            <sourcecode name="" type="http-message"><![CDATA[
Link: </temperature/Malm%C3%B6>;rel=live-environment-data
]]></sourcecode>
            <t>
a link-format document from the same source might describe the link as:  </t>

      <name>Limited Link Format</name>
      <t>The CoRE Link Format, as described in <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/>,
has been interpreted differently by implementers,
and a strict implementation
rules out some use cases of an RD
(e.g., base values with path components in combination with absent anchors).</t>
      <t>This appendix describes
a subset of link format documents called the Limited Link Format.
The one rule herein is not very limiting in practice --
all examples in <xref target="RFC6690" format="default"/> and all deployments the authors are aware of already stick to them --
but eases the implementation of RD servers.</t>
      <t>It is applicable to representations in the <tt>application/link-format</tt> media type
and any other media types that inherit <xref target="RFC6690" section="2.1" sectionFormat="comma"/>. </t>
      <t>A link format representation is in the Limited Link Format if,
for each link in it,
the following applies:</t>
      <t>All URI references either follow the URI or the path-absolute ABNF rule of
  <xref target="RFC3986" format="default"/> (i.e, the target and anchor each either start with a scheme or with a
  single slash).</t>
