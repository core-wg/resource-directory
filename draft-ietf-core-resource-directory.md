--- abstract

In many IoT applications, direct discovery of resources is not practical
due to sleeping nodes, or networks where multicast traffic
is inefficient. These problems can be solved by employing an entity called
a Resource Directory (RD), which contains information about resources held on
other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources. The input to an RD is composed of links and the output is composed of links constructed from the information stored in the RD. This
document specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup
and remove information on resources. Furthermore, new target attributes useful
in conjunction with an RD are defined.

# Introduction {#introduction}

In the work on Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE), a REST architecture
suitable for constrained nodes (e.g. with limited RAM and ROM {{?RFC7228}})
and networks (e.g. 6LoWPAN {{?RFC4944}})
has been established and is used in
Internet-of-Things (IoT) or
machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy
and building automation.

The discovery of resources offered by a constrained server is very important
in machine-to-machine applications where there are no humans in the loop and
static interfaces result in fragility. The discovery of resources provided by
an HTTP Web Server is typically called Web Linking {{RFC8288}}. The use of
Web Linking for the description and discovery of resources hosted by
constrained web servers is specified by the CoRE Link Format
{{RFC6690}}. However, {{RFC6690}} only describes how to discover
resources from the web server that hosts them by querying
`/.well-known/core`. In many constrained scenarios, direct discovery of resources is
not practical due to sleeping nodes, or networks where
multicast traffic is inefficient. These problems can be solved by employing
an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains information about resources held on
other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources.

This document specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup
and remove information on resources. Furthermore, new target attributes useful in
conjunction with an RD are defined. Although the examples in
this document show the use of these interfaces with CoAP {{RFC7252}}, they
can be applied in an equivalent manner to HTTP {{RFC7230}}.


# Terminology {#terminology}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for "octet".

This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms and
concepts that are discussed in {{RFC3986}}, {{RFC8288}} and {{RFC6690}}. Readers should
also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed in {{RFC7252}}.  To
describe the REST interfaces defined in this specification, the URI Template
format is used {{RFC6570}}.

This specification makes use of the following additional terminology:

{: vspace='0'}
resolve against
:   The expression "a URI-reference is *resolved against* a base URI" is used
to describe the process of {{RFC3986}} Section 5.2. Noteworthy corner cases are
that if the URI-reference is a (full) URI and resolved  against any base URI, that gives the original full URI, and
that resolving an empty URI reference gives the base URI without any fragment identifier.

Resource Directory (RD)
:   A web entity that stores information about web resources and implements the
REST interfaces defined in this specification for discovery, for the creation, maintenance and removal of registrations, and for lookup
of the registered resources.

Sector
:   In the context of an RD, a sector is a
logical grouping of endpoints.

    The abbreviation "d=" is used for the sector in query parameters for
compatibility with deployed implementations.

Endpoint
:   Endpoint (EP) is a term used to describe a web server or client in {{RFC7252}}.
In the context of this specification an endpoint is used to describe a
web server that registers resources to the RD. An endpoint
is identified by its endpoint name, which is included during registration,
and has a unique name within the associated sector of the registration.

Registration Base URI
:   The Base URI of a Registration is a URI that typically gives scheme and
authority information about an Endpoint. The Registration Base URI is provided at registration time, and is used by the RD to
resolve relative references of the registration into URIs.

Target
:   The target of a link is the destination address (URI) of the link. It is sometimes identified with "href=", or displayed as `<target>`. Relative targets need resolving with respect to the Base URI (section 5.2 of {{RFC3986}}).

    This use of the term Target is consistent with {{RFC8288}}'s use of the term.

Context
:   The context of a link is the source address (URI) of the link,
    and describes which resource is linked to the target.
    A link's context is made explicit in serialized links as the "anchor=" attribute.

    This use of the term Context is consistent with {{RFC8288}}'s use of the term.

Directory Resource
:  A resource in the RD containing registration resources.

Registration Resource
:  A resource in the RD that contains information about an Endpoint and its links.

Commissioning Tool
: Commissioning Tool (CT) is a device that assists during installation events
by assigning values to parameters, naming endpoints and groups, or adapting
the installation to the needs of the applications.

Registrant-ep
:    Registrant-ep is the endpoint that is registered into the RD. The registrant-ep can register itself, or a CT registers the registrant-ep.

RDAO
: Resource Directory Address Option.
  A new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option defined for announcing an RD's address.



# Architecture and Use Cases {#arch}

## Principles

The RD is primarily a tool to make discovery operations more
efficient than querying /.well-known/core on all connected devices, or across
boundaries that would limit those operations.

It provides information about resources hosted by other devices that could otherwise only be obtained by
directly querying the /.well-known/core resource on these other devices, either by a unicast request or a multicast request.

Information SHOULD only be stored in the RD
if it can be obtained by querying the described device's
/.well-known/core resource directly.

Data in the RD can only be provided by the
device which hosts those data or a dedicated Commissioning Tool (CT).
These CTs act on behalf of endpoints too constrained, or generally
unable, to present that information themselves. No other client can modify data
in the RD. Changes to the information in the RD do not propagate automatically back to the web servers from where the information originated.

## Architecture

The RD architecture is illustrated in {{fig-arch}}. An
RD is used as a repository of registrations
describing resources hosted on other web servers, also called endpoints
(EP).
An endpoint is a web server associated with a scheme, IP address and port. A physical node may host one or more endpoints. The
RD implements a set of REST interfaces for endpoints to register and maintain
RD registrations, and for endpoints to
lookup resources from the RD. An RD can be logically segmented by the use of Sectors.

A mechanism to discover an RD using CoRE Link Format {{RFC6690}} is defined.

Registrations
in the RD are soft state and need to be periodically refreshed.

An endpoint uses specific interfaces to register, update and remove a registration. It is also possible for an RD to fetch Web Links
from endpoints and add their contents to its registrations.

At the first registration of an endpoint, a "registration resource" is created,
the location of which is returned to the registering endpoint. The registering
endpoint uses this registration resource to manage the contents of registrations.

A lookup interface for discovering any of the Web Links stored in the RD is
provided using the CoRE Link Format.

{: #fig-arch title='The RD architecture.' align="left"}


A Registrant-EP MAY keep concurrent registrations to more than one RD at the same time
if explicitly configured to do so,
but that is not expected to be supported by typical EP implementations.
Any such registrations are independent of each other.
The usual expectation when multiple discovery mechanisms or addresses are configured
is that they constitute a fall-back path for a single registration.


## RD Content Model {#ER-model}

The Entity-Relationship (ER) models shown in {{fig-ER-WKC}} and {{fig-ER-RD}} model the contents of /.well-known/core and the RD respectively, with entity-relationship diagrams [ER][]. Entities (rectangles) are used for concepts that exist independently. Attributes (ovals) are used for concepts that exist only in connection with a related entity. Relations (diamonds) give a semantic meaning to the relation between entities. Numbers specify the cardinality of the relations.

Some of the attribute values are URIs. Those values are always full URIs and never relative references in the information model.
They can, however, be expressed as relative references in serializations, and often are.

These models provide an abstract view of the information expressed in link-format documents and an RD. They cover the concepts, but not necessarily all details of an RD's operation; they are meant to give an overview, and not be a template for implementations.

{: #fig-ER-WKC title='ER Model of the content of /.well-known/core' align="left"}

The model shown in {{fig-ER-WKC}} models the contents of /.well-known/core which contains:

* a set of links belonging to the hosting web server

The web server is free to choose links it deems appropriate to be exposed in its `/.well-known/core`.
Typically, the links describe resources that are served by the host, but the set can also contain links to resources on other servers (see examples in {{RFC6690}} page 14).
The set does not necessarily contain links to all resources served by the host.

A link has the following attributes (see {{RFC8288}}):

* Zero or more link relations: They describe relations between the link context and the link target.

  In link-format serialization, they are expressed as space-separated values in the "rel" attribute, and default to "hosts".

* A link context URI: It defines the source of the relation, e.g. *who* "hosts" something.

  In link-format serialization, it is expressed in the "anchor" attribute and defaults to the Origin of the target (practically: the target with its path and later components removed)

* A link target URI: It defines the destination of the relation (e.g. *what* is hosted), and is the topic of all target attributes.

    In link-format serialization, it is expressed between angular brackets, and sometimes called the "href".

* Other target attributes (e.g. resource type (rt), interface (if), or content format (ct)).
  These provide additional information about the target URI.

{: #fig-ER-RD title='ER Model of the content of the RD' align="left"}

The model shown in {{fig-ER-RD}} models the contents of the RD which contains in addition to /.well-known/core:

* 0 to n Registrations of endpoints,

A registration is associated with one endpoint. A registration defines a set of links as defined for /.well-known/core. A Registration has six types of attributes:

* an endpoint name ("ep", a Unicode string) unique within a sector
* a Registration Base URI ("base", a URI typically describing the scheme://authority part)
* a lifetime ("lt"),
* a registration resource location inside the RD ("href"),
* optionally a sector ("d", a Unicode string)
* optional additional endpoint attributes (from {{iana-registry}})

The cardinality of "base" is currently 1;
future documents are invited to extend the RD specification to support multiple values (e.g. {{I-D.silverajan-core-coap-protocol-negotiation}}).
Its value is used as a Base URI when resolving URIs in the links contained in the endpoint.

Links are modelled as they are in {{fig-ER-WKC}}.

## Link-local addresses and zone identifiers {#linklocal}

Registration Base URIs can contain link-local IP addresses.
To be usable across hosts, those cannot be serialized to contain zone identifiers (see {{RFC6874}} Section 1).

Link-local addresses can only be used on a single link
(therefore RD servers cannot announce them when queried on a different link),
and lookup clients using them need to keep track of which interface they got them from.

Therefore, it is advisable in many scenarios
to use addresses with larger scope if available.

## Use Case: Cellular M2M {#cellular}

Over the last few years, mobile operators around the world
have focused on development of M2M solutions in order to
expand the business to the new type of users: machines. The
machines are connected directly to a mobile network using an appropriate
embedded wireless interface (GSM/GPRS, WCDMA, LTE) or via a gateway providing
short and wide range wireless interfaces.
The ambition in such systems is to build them from reusable components.
These speed up development and deployment,
and enable shared use of machines across different applications.
One crucial component of such systems
is the discovery of resources (and thus the endpoints they are hosted on) capable of providing required
information at a given time or acting on instructions from the end users.

Imagine a scenario where endpoints installed on vehicles enable
tracking of the position of these vehicles for fleet management purposes and allow
monitoring of environment parameters. During the boot-up process
endpoints register with an RD, which is hosted by the
mobile operator or somewhere in the cloud. Periodically, these endpoints
update their registration and may modify resources they offer.

When endpoints are not always connected, for example because they enter
a sleep mode, a remote server is usually used to provide proxy access to
the endpoints. Mobile apps or web applications for environment monitoring contact the RD, look up the endpoints capable of providing information about the environment using an appropriate set of link parameters, obtain information on how to contact them (URLs of the proxy server), and then initiate interaction to obtain information that is finally processed, displayed on the screen and usually stored in a database. Similarly, fleet management systems provide
the appropriate link parameters to the RD to look up for EPs deployed on
the vehicles the application is responsible for.


## Use Case: Home and Building Automation {#automation}

Home and commercial building automation systems can benefit from the use
of IoT web services.  The discovery requirements of these applications are
demanding. Home automation usually relies on run-time discovery to commission
the system, whereas in building automation a combination of professional
commissioning and run-time discovery is used. Both home and building automation
involve peer-to-peer interactions between endpoints, and involve battery-powered
sleeping devices.
Both can use the common RD infrastructure to establish device interactions efficiently,
but can pick security policies suitable for their needs.

Two phases can be discerned for a network servicing the system: (1) installation and (2) operation. During the operational phase, the network is connected to the Internet with a Border Router (e.g. a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR), see {{RFC6775}}) and the nodes connected to the network can use the Internet services that are provided by the Internet Provider or the network administrator. During the installation phase, the network is completely stand-alone, no Border Router is connected, and the network only supports the IP communication between the connected nodes. The installation phase is usually followed by the operational phase.
As an RD's operations work without hard dependencies on names or addresses,
it can be used for discovery across both phases.


## Use Case: Link Catalogues {#usecase-catalogues}

Resources may be shared through data brokers that have no knowledge beforehand
of who is going to consume the data. An RD can be used to hold
links about resources and services hosted anywhere to make them discoverable
by a general class of applications.

For example, environmental and weather sensors that generate data for public
consumption may provide data to an intermediary server, or broker. Sensor
data are published to the intermediary upon changes or at regular intervals.
Descriptions of the sensors that resolve to links to sensor data may be published
to an RD. Applications wishing to consume the data can use
RD Lookup to discover and resolve links
to the desired resources and endpoints. The RD service need
not be coupled with the data intermediary service. Mapping of RDs
to data intermediaries may be many-to-many.

Metadata in web link formats like {{RFC6690}} which may be internally stored as  triples, or relation/attribute
pairs providing metadata about resource links, need to be supported by RDs. External catalogues that are
represented in other formats may be converted to common web linking formats for
storage and access by RDs. Since it is common practice for these
to be encoded in URNs {{?RFC8141}}, simple and lossless structural transforms should
generally be sufficient to store external metadata in RDs.

The additional features of an RD allow sectors to be defined
to enable access to a particular set of resources from particular applications.
This provides isolation and protection of sensitive data when needed. Application groups with multicast addresses may be defined to support efficient data transport.

# RD discovery and other interface-independent components

This and the following sections define the required set of REST interfaces between an RD,
endpoints and lookup clients. Although the examples throughout these sections assume the use of
CoAP {{RFC7252}}, these REST interfaces can also be realized using HTTP {{RFC7230}}.
The multicast discovery and simple registration operations are exceptions to that,
as they rely on mechanisms unavailable in HTTP.
In all definitions in these sections, both CoAP response codes (with dot notation) and HTTP response codes
(without dot notation) are shown. An RD implementing this specification MUST support
the discovery, registration, update, lookup, and removal interfaces.

All operations on the contents of the RD MUST be atomic and idempotent.

For several operations, interface templates are given in list form;
those describe the operation participants, request codes, URIs, content formats and outcomes.
Sections of those templates contain normative content about
Interaction, Method, URI Template and URI Template Variables
as well as the details of the Success condition.
The additional sections
on options like Content-Format and on Failure codes
give typical cases that an implementation of the RD should deal with.
Those serve to illustrate the typical responses
to readers who are not yet familiar with all the details of CoAP based interfaces;
they do not limit what a server may respond under atypical circumstances.

REST clients (registrant-EPs and CTs during registration and maintenance, lookup clients, RD servers during simple registrations)
must be prepared to receive any unsuccessful code and act upon it
according to its definition, options and/or payload to the best of their capabilities,
falling back to failing the operation if recovery is not possible.
In particular, they SHOULD retry the request upon 5.03 (Service Unavailable; 503 in HTTP)
according to the Max-Age (Retry-After in HTTP) option,
and SHOULD fall back to link-format when receiving 4.15 (Unsupported Content-Format; 415 in HTTP).

An RD MAY make the information submitted to it available to further
directories (subject to security policies on link confidentiality),
if it can ensure that a loop does not form.  The protocol used
between directories to ensure loop-free operation is outside the scope of
this document.

## Finding a Resource Directory {#finding_an_rd}

A (re-)starting device may want to find one or more RDs
before it can discover their URIs. Dependent on the operational conditions, one or more of the techniques below apply.

The device may be pre-configured to exercise specific mechanisms for
finding the RD:

1. It may be configured with a specific IP address for the RD.  That IP
   address may also be an anycast address, allowing the network to
   forward RD requests to an RD that is topologically close; each
   target network environment in which some of these preconfigured
   nodes are to be brought up is then configured with a route for this
   anycast address that leads to an appropriate RD.  (Instead of using
   an anycast address, a multicast address can also be preconfigured.
   The RD servers then need to configure one of their
   interfaces with this multicast address.)
2. It may be configured with a DNS name for the RD and use DNS to return
   the IP address of the RD; it can find a DNS server to perform the lookup using the usual mechanisms for finding DNS servers.
3. It may be configured to use a service discovery mechanism such as
   DNS-SD, as outlined in {{rd-using-dnssd}}.

For cases where the device is not specifically configured with a way
to find an RD, the network may want to provide a
suitable default.

3. The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option RDAO {{rdao}} can do that.
4. When DHCP is in use,
   this could be provided via a DHCP option (no such option is defined
   at the time of writing).

Finally, if neither the device nor the network offers any specific
configuration, the device may want to employ heuristics to find a
suitable RD.

The present specification does not fully define these heuristics, but
suggests a number of candidates:

5. In a 6LoWPAN, just assume the Border Router (6LBR) can act as an
   RD (using the ABRO option to find that {{RFC6775}}).
   Confirmation can be obtained by sending a unicast to
   `coap://[6LBR]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd*`.

6. In a network that supports multicast well, discovering the RD using
   a multicast query for /.well-known/core as specified in CoRE Link
   Format {{RFC6690}}: Sending a Multicast GET to
   `coap://[MCD1]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd*`.  RDs within the
   multicast scope will answer the query.

 When answering a multicast request directed at a link-local group,
  the RD may want to respond from a routable address;
  this makes it easier for registrants to use one of their own routable addresses for registration.
When {{?RFC6724}} is used for source address selection,
this can be achieved by applying the changes of its Section 10.4,
picking public addresses in its Section 5 Rule 7,
and superseding rule 8 with preferring the source address's precedence.

As some of the RD addresses obtained by the methods listed here are
just (more or less educated) guesses, endpoints MUST make use of any
error messages to very strictly rate-limit requests to candidate IP
addresses that don't work out.  For example, an ICMP Destination
Unreachable message (and, in particular, the port unreachable code for
this message) may indicate the lack of a CoAP server on the candidate
host, or a CoAP error response code such as 4.05 "Method Not Allowed"
may indicate unwillingness of a CoAP server to act as a directory
server.

The following RD discovery mechanisms are recommended:

  * In managed networks with border routers that need stand-alone operation, the RDAO option is recommended (e.g. operational phase described in {{automation}}).
  * In managed networks without border router (no Internet services available), the use of a preconfigured anycast address is recommended (e.g. installation phase described in {{automation}}).
  * In networks managed using DNS-SD, the use of DNS-SD for discovery as described in {{rd-using-dnssd}} is recommended.

The use of multicast discovery in mesh networks is NOT RECOMMENDED.


### Resource Directory Address Option (RDAO) {#rdao}

The Resource Directory Address Option (RDAO) carries
information about the address of the RD in RAs (Router Advertisements) of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND),
similar to how RDNSS options {{?RFC8106}} are sent. This information is
needed when endpoints cannot discover the RD with a link-local
or realm-local scope multicast address, for instance because the
endpoint and the RD are separated by a Border Router
(6LBR). In many circumstances the availability of DHCP cannot be guaranteed either
during commissioning of the network. The presence and the use of the RD is
essential during commissioning.

It is possible to send multiple RDAO options in one message,
indicating as many RD addresses.

The RDAO format is:

### Using DNS-SD to discover a Resource Directory {#rd-using-dnssd}

An RD can advertise its presence in DNS-SD {{RFC6763}}
using the service name `_core-rd._udp` (for CoAP), `_core-rd-dtls._udp` (for CoAP over DTLS),
`_core-rd._tcp` (for CoAP over TCP) or `_core-rd-tls._tcp` (for CoAP over TLS)
defined in this document.
(For the WebSocket transports of CoAP, no service is defined
as DNS-SD is typically unavailable in environments where CoAP over WebSockets is used).

The selection of the service indicates the protocol used, and
the SRV record points the client to a host name and port to use as a starting point for the URI discovery steps of {{discovery}}.

This section is a simplified concrete application of the more generic mechanism
specified in {{I-D.ietf-core-rd-dns-sd}}.

## Payload Content Formats

RDs implementing this specification MUST support the
application/link-format content format (ct=40).

RDs implementing this specification MAY support additional content formats.

Any additional content format supported by an RD implementing this
specification SHOULD be able to express all the information expressible in link-format.
It MAY be able to express information that is inexpressible in link-format,
but those expressions SHOULD be avoided where possible.


## URI Discovery {#discovery}

Before an endpoint can make use of an RD, it must first know the RD's address
and port, and the URI path information for its REST APIs. This section defines
discovery of the RD and its URIs using the well-known interface of the
CoRE Link Format {{RFC6690}} after having discovered a host as described in {{finding_an_rd}}.

Discovery of the RD registration URI is performed by sending either a multicast or
unicast GET request to `/.well-known/core` and including a Resource Type (rt)
parameter {{RFC6690}} with the value "core.rd" in the query string. Likewise, a
Resource Type parameter value of "core.rd-lookup\*" is used to discover the
URIs for RD Lookup operations, core.rd\* is used to discover all URIs for RD operations.
Upon success, the response will contain a payload with
a link format entry for each RD function discovered, indicating the URI
of the RD function returned and the corresponding Resource Type. When performing
multicast discovery, the multicast IP address used will depend on the scope required
and the multicast capabilities of the network (see {{mc-registration}}).

An RD MAY provide hints about the content-formats it supports in the links it exposes or registers, using the "ct" target attribute, as shown in the example below. Clients MAY use these hints to select alternate content-formats for interaction with the RD.

HTTP does not support multicast and consequently only unicast discovery can be supported
at the using the HTTP `/.well-known/core` resource.

RDs implementing this specification MUST support query filtering for
the rt parameter as defined in {{RFC6690}}.

While the link targets in this discovery step are often expressed in path-absolute form,
this is not a requirement.
Clients of the RD SHOULD therefore accept URIs of all schemes they support,
both as URIs and relative references,
and not limit the set of discovered URIs to those hosted at the address used for URI discovery.

With security policies where the client requires the RD to be authorized to act as an RD,
that authorization may be limited to resources on which the authorized RD advertises the adequate resource types.
Clients that have obtained links they can not rely on yet
can repeat the URI discovery step at the /.well-known/core resource of the indicated host
to obtain the resource type information from an authorized source.

The URI Discovery operation can yield multiple URIs of a given resource type.
The client of the RD can use any of the discovered addresses initially.

The discovery request interface is specified as follows
(this is exactly the Well-Known Interface of {{RFC6690}} Section 4,
with the additional requirement that the server MUST support query filtering):

Interaction:
: EP, CT or Client -> RD

Method:
: GET

URI Template:
: /.well-known/core{?rt}

URI Template Variables:
: rt :=
  : Resource Type. SHOULD contain one of the values "core.rd", "core.rd-lookup\*",
  "core.rd-lookup-res", "core.rd-lookup-ep", or "core.rd\*"

Accept:
: absent, application/link-format or any other media type representing web links

The following response is expected on this interface:

Success:
: 2.05 "Content" or 200 "OK" with an
  application/link-format or other web link payload containing one or more matching entries for the RD resource.

The following example shows an endpoint discovering an RD using this interface,
thus learning that the directory resource location, in this example, is /rd, and that the
content-format delivered by the server hosting the resource is application/link-format
(ct=40).  Note that it is up to the RD to choose its RD locations.

Req: GET coap://[MCD1]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd*

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
</rd>;rt=core.rd;ct=40,
</rd-lookup/ep>;rt=core.rd-lookup-ep;ct=40,
</rd-lookup/res>;rt=core.rd-lookup-res;ct=40
~~~~
{: #example-discovery title="Example discovery exchange" }

The following example shows the way of indicating that a client may request
alternate content-formats. The Content-Format code attribute "ct" MAY include a
space-separated sequence of Content-Format codes as specified in
Section 7.2.1 of {{RFC7252}}, indicating that multiple content-formats are available.
The example below shows the required Content-Format 40 (application/link-format)
indicated as well as a CBOR and JSON representation from {{I-D.ietf-core-links-json}}
(which have no numeric values assigned yet, so they are shown as TBD64 and TBD504 as in that draft).
The RD resource locations /rd, and /rd-lookup are example values.
The server in this example also indicates that it is capable of providing observation on resource lookups.

~~~~
{: #example-discovery-ct title="Example discovery exchange indicating additional content-formats" }

For maintenance, management and debugging,
it can be useful to identify the components that constitute the RD server.
The identification can be used to find client-server incompatibilities,
supported features, required updates and other aspects.
The Well-Known interface described in Section 4 of {{RFC6690}} can be used to find such data.

It
would typically be stored in an implementation information link
(as described in {{?I-D.bormann-t2trg-rel-impl}}):

~~~~
Req: GET /.well-known/core?rel=impl-info

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
<http://software.example.com/shiny-resource-directory/1.0beta1>;
    rel=impl-info
~~~~
{: #example-impl-discovery title="Example exchange of obtaining implementation information, using the relation type currently proposed in the work-in-progress document" }

Note that depending on the particular server's architecture,
such a link could be anchored at the RD server's root
(as in this example), or
at individual RD components.
The latter is to be expected when different applications
are run on the same server.


# Registration {#registration}

After discovering the location of an RD, a registrant-ep or CT MAY
register the resources of the registrant-ep using the registration interface. This interface
accepts a POST from an endpoint containing the list of resources to be added
to the directory as the message payload in the CoRE Link Format {{RFC6690}} or other representations of web links, along with query
parameters indicating the name of the endpoint, and optionally the sector,
lifetime and base URI of the registration.
It is expected that other specifications will define further parameters (see
{{iana-registry}}). The RD then creates a new registration resource in the RD and returns its location. The receiving endpoint MUST use that
location when refreshing registrations using this interface. Registration
resources in the RD are kept active for the period indicated by the lifetime
parameter. The creating endpoint is responsible for refreshing the registration resource within this
period using either the registration or update interface. The registration
interface MUST be implemented to be idempotent, so that registering twice
with the same endpoint parameters ep and d (sector) does not create multiple registration resources.

The following rules apply for a registration request targeting a given (ep, d) value pair:

* When the (ep, d) value pair of the registration-request is different from any existing registration,
  a new registration is generated.
* When the (ep, d) value pair of the registration-request is equal to an existing registration,
  the content and parameters of the existing registration are replaced with the content of the registration request.
  Like the later changes to registration resources, security policies ({{policies}}) usually require such requests to come from the same device.

The posted link-format document can (and typically does) contain relative references
both in its link targets and in its anchors, or contain empty anchors.
The RD server needs to resolve these references in order to faithfully represent them in lookups.
They are resolved against the base URI of the registration,
which is provided either explicitly in the `base` parameter or constructed implicitly from the requester's URI as constructed from its network address and scheme.

For media types to which {{limitedlinkformat}} applies
(i.e. documents in application/link-format),
request bodies MUST be expressed in Limited Link Format.

The registration request interface is specified as follows:

Interaction:
: EP or CT -> RD


Method:
: POST


URI Template:
: {+rd}{?ep,d,lt,base,extra-attrs\*}


URI Template Variables:
: rd :=
  : RD registration URI
    (mandatory). This is the location of
    the RD, as obtained from discovery.

  ep :=
  : Endpoint name (mostly mandatory). The endpoint name is an identifier
    that MUST be unique within a sector.

    As the endpoint name is a Unicode string,
    it is encoded in UTF-8 (and possibly pct-encoded) during variable expansion (see {{RFC6570}} Section 3.2.1).
    The endpoint name MUST NOT contain any character in the inclusive ranges 0-31 or 127-159.

    The maximum length of this parameter is 63 UTF-8 encoded bytes.

    If the RD is configured to recognize the endpoint to be authorized to use exactly one endpoint name, the RD assigns that name.
    In that case, giving the endpoint name becomes optional for the client;
    if the client gives any other endpoint name, it is not authorized to perform the registration.

  d :=
  : Sector (optional). The sector to which this endpoint belongs.
    When this parameter is not present, the
    RD MAY associate the endpoint with a configured default sector
    (possibly based on the endpoint's authorization)
    or leave it empty.

    The sector is encoded like the ep parameter, and is limited to 63 UTF-8 encoded bytes as well.

  lt :=
  : Lifetime (optional). Lifetime of the registration in seconds. Range of 1-4294967295.
    If no lifetime is included in the initial registration, a default value of
    90000 (25 hours) SHOULD be assumed.

  base :=
  : Base URI (optional). This parameter sets the base URI of the registration, under which
    the relative links in the payload are to be interpreted. The specified URI typically does not have a path component of its own, and MUST be suitable as a base URI to resolve any relative references given in the registration. The parameter is therefore usually of the shape "scheme://authority" for
    HTTP and CoAP URIs.
    The URI SHOULD NOT have a query or fragment component
    as any non-empty relative part in a reference would remove those parts from the resulting URI.

  : In the absence of this parameter the scheme of the protocol, source address
    and source port of the registration request are assumed.
    The Base URI is consecutively constructed by concatenating the used protocol's scheme
    with the characters "://", the requester's source address as an address
    literal and ":" followed by its port (if it was not the protocol's default
    one) in analogy to {{RFC7252}} Section 6.5.

  : This parameter is
    mandatory when the directory is filled by a third party such as an
    commissioning tool.

  : If the registrant-ep uses an ephemeral port to register with, it MUST include the base
    parameter in the registration to provide a valid network path.

  : A registrant that cannot be reached by potential lookup clients at the address it registers from
     (e.g. because it is behind some form of Network Address Translation (NAT))
     MUST provide a reachable base address with its registration.

  : If the Base URI contains a link-local IP literal, it MUST NOT contain a Zone Identifier,
    and MUST be local to the link on which the registration request is received.

  : Endpoints that register with a base that contains a path component
    cannot efficiently express their registrations in Limited Link Format ({{limitedlinkformat}}).
    Those applications should use different representations of links to which {{limitedlinkformat}} is not applicable
    (e.g. {{?I-D.hartke-t2trg-coral}}).
    <!-- or may just use unlimited link format if there is indication that the server is not strict about it -->

  extra-attrs :=
  : Additional registration attributes (optional). The endpoint can pass any
    parameter registered at {{iana-registry}} to the directory. If the RD is
    aware of the parameter's specified semantics, it processes it accordingly.
    Otherwise, it MUST store the unknown key and its value(s) as an endpoint
    attribute for further lookup.

Content-Format:
: application/link-format or any other indicated media type representing web links

The following response is expected on this interface:

Success:
: 2.01 "Created" or 201 "Created". The Location-Path option or Location header field
  MUST be included in the response. This location MUST be a stable identifier
  generated by the RD as it is used for all subsequent
  operations on this registration resource. The registration resource location thus returned is for the purpose of updating the lifetime
  of the registration and for maintaining the content of the
  registered links, including updating and deleting links.

: A registration with an already registered ep and d value pair
  responds with the same success code and location as the original registration;
  the set of links registered with the endpoint is replaced with the links
  from the payload.

: The location MUST NOT have a query or fragment component,
  as that could conflict with query parameters during the Registration Update operation.
  Therefore, the Location-Query option MUST NOT be present in a successful response.

If the registration fails, including request timeouts,
or if delays from Service Unavailable responses with Max-Age or Retry-After
accumulate to exceed the registrant's configured timeouts,
it SHOULD pick another registration URI from the "URI Discovery" step
and if there is only one or the list is exhausted,
pick other choices from the "Finding a Resource Directory" step.
Care has to be taken to consider the freshness of results obtained earlier,
e.g. of the result of a `/.well-known/core` response,
the lifetime of an RDAO option and
of DNS responses.
Any rate limits and persistent errors from the "Finding a Resource Directory" step
must be considered for the whole registration time,
not only for a single operation.


The following example shows a registrant-ep with the name "node1" registering
two resources to an RD using this interface. The location "/rd"
is an example RD location discovered in a request similar to {{example-discovery}}.

## Simple Registration {#simple}

Not all endpoints hosting resources are expected to know how to upload links to an RD as described in {{registration}}. Instead, simple endpoints can implement the Simple Registration approach described in this section. An RD implementing this specification MUST implement Simple Registration. However, there may
be security reasons why this form of directory discovery would be disabled.

This approach requires that the registrant-ep makes available the hosted resources
that it wants to be discovered, as links on its `/.well-known/core` interface as
specified in {{RFC6690}}.
The links in that document are subject to the same limitations as the payload of a registration
(with respect to {{limitedlinkformat}}).

* The registrant-ep finds one or more addresses of the directory server as described in {{finding_an_rd}}.

* The registrant-ep sends (and regularly refreshes with) a POST
request to the `/.well-known/rd` URI of the directory server of choice. The body of the POST request is empty, and triggers the resource
directory server to perform GET requests at the requesting registrant-ep's /.well-known/core to obtain the link-format payload to register.

  The registrant-ep includes the same registration parameters in the POST request as it would with a regular registration per {{registration}}. The registration base URI of the registration is taken from the registrant-ep's network address (as is default with regular registrations).

  Example request from registrant-EP to RD (unanswered until the next step):

~~~~
Req: POST /.well-known/rd?lt=6000&ep=node1
(No payload)
~~~~
{: #example-simple1 title="First half example exchange of a simple registration" }

* The RD queries the registrant-ep's discovery resource to determine the success of the operation.
It SHOULD keep a cache of the discovery resource and not query it again as long as it is fresh.

  Example request from the RD to the registrant-EP:

~~~~
Req: GET /.well-known/core
Accept: 40

Res: 2.05 Content
Content-Format: 40
Payload:
</sen/temp>
~~~~
{: #example-simple2 title="Example exchange of the RD querying the simple endpoint" }

  With this response, the RD would answer the previous step's request:

~~~~
Res: 2.04 Changed
~~~~
{: #example-simple3 title="Second half example exchange of a simple registration" }

The sequence of fetching the registration content before sending a successful response
was chosen to make responses reliable,
and the point about caching was chosen to still allow very constrained registrants.
Registrants MUST be able to serve a GET request to `/.well-known/core` after having requested registration.
Constrained devices MAY regard the initial request as temporarily failed when they need RAM occupied by their own request to serve the RD's GET,
and retry later when the RD already has a cached representation of their discovery resources.
Then, the RD can reply immediately and the registrant can receive the response.

The simple registration request interface is specified as follows:

Interaction:
: EP -> RD


Method:
: POST


URI Template:
: /.well-known/rd{?ep,d,lt,extra-attrs\*}

URI Template Variables are as they are for registration in {{registration}}.
The base attribute is not accepted to keep the registration interface simple;
that rules out registration over CoAP-over-TCP or HTTP that would need to specify one.
For some time during this document's development, the URI template `/.well-known/core{?ep,...}` has been in use instead.

The following response is expected on this interface:

Success:
: 2.04 "Changed".


For the second interaction triggered by the above, the registrant-ep takes the role of server and the RD the role of client.
(Note that this is exactly the Well-Known Interface of {{RFC6690}} Section 4):
<!-- the above paragraph could just as well be any other text;
what matters is that the tables above and below are clearly separated. -->

Interaction:
: RD -> EP


Method:
: GET


URI Template:
: /.well-known/core


The following response is expected on this interface:

Success:
: 2.05 "Content".


When the RD uses any authorization credentials to access the endpoint's discovery resource,
or when it is deployed in a location where third parties might reach it but not the endpoint,
it SHOULD verify that the apparent registrant-ep intends to register with the given registration parameters
before revealing the obtained discovery information to lookup clients.
An easy way to do that is to verify the simple registration request's sender address using the Echo option as described in {{I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag}} Section 2.4.

The RD MUST delete registrations created by simple registration after the expiration of their lifetime. Additional operations on the registration resource cannot be executed because no registration location is returned.


## Third-party registration {#third-party-registration}

For some applications, even Simple Registration may be too taxing
for some very constrained devices, in particular if the security requirements
become too onerous.

In a controlled environment (e.g. building control), the RD
can be filled by a third party device, called a Commissioning Tool (CT). The commissioning
tool can fill the RD from a database or other means. For
that purpose scheme, IP address and port of the URI of the registered device is
 the value of the "base" parameter of the registration described in {{registration}}.

It should be noted that the value of the "base" parameter applies to all the links of the registration and has consequences for the anchor value of the individual links as exemplified in {{weblink}}. An eventual (currently non-existing) "base" attribute of the link is not affected by the value of "base" parameter in the registration.

## Operations on the Registration Resource

This section describes how the registering endpoint can maintain the registrations that it created. The registering endpoint can be the registrant-ep or the CT. The registrations are resources of the RD.

An endpoint should not use this interface for registrations that it did not create.
This is usually enforced by security policies,
which in general require equivalent credentials for creation of and operations on a registration.

After the initial registration, the registering endpoint retains the returned location of the registration resource for further operations, including refreshing the registration in order to extend the lifetime and "keep-alive" the registration. When the lifetime of the registration has expired, the RD SHOULD NOT respond to discovery queries concerning this endpoint. The RD SHOULD continue to provide access to the registration resource after a registration time-out occurs in order to enable the registering endpoint to eventually refresh the registration. The RD MAY eventually remove the registration resource for the purpose of garbage collection. If the registration resource is removed, the corresponding endpoint will need to be re-registered.

The registration resource may also be used cancel the registration using DELETE, and to perform further operations beyond the scope of this specification.

Operations on the registration resource are sensitive to reordering;
{{freshness}} describes how order is restored.

The operations on the registration resource are described below.

### Registration Update {#update}

The update interface is used by the registering endpoint to refresh or update its
registration with an RD. To use the interface, the registering endpoint sends a POST request to the registration resource returned by the initial registration operation.

An update MAY update registration parameters like lifetime, base URI or others.
Parameters that are not being changed should not
be included in an update. Adding parameters that have not changed increases
the size of the message but does not have any other implications.
Parameters are included as query parameters in an update operation as
in {{registration}}.

A registration update resets the timeout of the registration to the (possibly
updated) lifetime of the registration, independent of whether a `lt` parameter
was given.

If the base URI of the registration is changed in an update,
relative references submitted in the original registration or later updates are resolved anew against the new base.

The registration update operation only describes the use of POST with an empty payload.
Future standards might describe the semantics of using content formats and payloads
with the POST method to update the links of a registration (see {{link-up}}).

The update registration request interface is specified as follows:

Interaction:
: EP or CT -> RD

Method:
: POST

URI Template:
: {+location}{?lt,base,extra-attrs\*}


URI Template Variables:
: location :=
  : This is the Location returned by the RD as a result of a successful
    earlier registration.

  lt :=
  : Lifetime (optional). Lifetime of the registration in seconds. Range of 1-4294967295.
    If no lifetime is included, the previous last
  lifetime set on a previous update or the original registration
  (falling back to 90000) SHOULD be used.


  base :=
  : Base URI (optional). This parameter updates the Base URI established in the
    original registration to a new value,
    and is subject to
    the same restrictions as in the registration.

    If the parameter is set in an update, it is stored by the RD as the new
    Base URI under which to interpret the relative links present in the payload of the original registration.

    If the parameter is not set in the request but was set before, the previous
    Base URI value is kept unmodified.

    If the parameter is not set in the request and was not set before either, the
    source address and source port of the update request are stored as the
    Base URI.

  extra-attrs :=
  : Additional registration attributes (optional). As with the registration,
    the RD processes them if it knows their semantics. Otherwise, unknown
    attributes are stored as endpoint attributes, overriding any previously
    stored endpoint attributes of the same key.

  : Note that this default behavior does not allow removing an endpoint attribute in an update.
    For attributes whose functionality depends on the endpoints' ability to remove them in an update,
    it can make sense to define a value whose presence is equivalent to the absence of a value.
    As an alternative, an extension can define different updating rules for their attributes.
    That necessitates either discovery of whether the RD is aware of that extension,
    or tolerating the default behavior.

Content-Format:
: none (no payload)

The following responses are expected on this interface:

Success:
: 2.04 "Changed" or 204 "No Content" if the update was successfully processed.

Failure:
: 4.04 "Not Found" or 404 "Not Found". Registration does not exist (e.g. may have been removed).

If the registration update fails in any way, including "Not Found" and request timeouts,
or if the time indicated in a Service Unavailable Max-Age/Retry-After exceeds the remaining lifetime,
the registering endpoint SHOULD attempt registration again.


The following example shows how the registering endpoint resets the timeout on its registration resource at
an RD using this interface with the example location value: /rd/4521.

~~~~
Req: POST /rd/4521

Res: 2.04 Changed
~~~~
{: #example-update title="Example update of a registration" }

The following example shows the registering endpoint updating its registration resource at
an RD using this interface with the example location value: /rd/4521. The initial registration by the registering endpoint set the following values:

* endpoint name (ep)=endpoint1
* lifetime (lt)=500
* Base URI (base)=coap://local-proxy-old.example.com
* payload of {{example-payload}}

The initial state of the RD is reflected in the following request:

~~~~
Req: GET /rd-lookup/res?ep=endpoint1

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
<coap://local-proxy-old.example.com/sensors/temp>;
    rt=temperature-c;if=sensor,
<http://www.example.com/sensors/temp>;
    anchor="coap://local-proxy-old.example.com/sensors/temp";
    rel=describedby
~~~~
{: #example-update-base-lookup-pre title="Example lookup before a change to the base address" }

The following example shows the registering endpoint changing the Base URI to `coaps://new.example.com:5684`:

~~~~
Req: POST /rd/4521?base=coaps://new.example.com

Res: 2.04 Changed
~~~~
{: #example-update-base title="Example registration update that changes the base address" }

The consecutive query returns:

~~~~
Req: GET /rd-lookup/res?ep=endpoint1

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
<coaps://new.example.com/sensors/temp>;
    rt=temperature-c;if=sensor,
<http://www.example.com/sensors/temp>;
    anchor="coaps://new.example.com/sensors/temp";
    rel=describedby
~~~~
{: #example-update-base-lookup-post title="Example lookup after a change to the base address" }

### Registration Removal {#removal}

Although RD registrations have soft state and will eventually timeout after their
lifetime, the registering endpoint SHOULD explicitly remove an entry from the RD if it
knows it will no longer be available (for example on shut-down). This is
accomplished using a removal interface on the RD by performing a DELETE on
the endpoint resource.

The removal request interface is specified as follows:

Interaction:
: EP or CT -> RD

Method:
: DELETE

URI Template:
: {+location}

URI Template Variables:
: location :=
  : This is the Location returned by the RD as a result of a successful
    earlier registration.

The following responses are expected on this interface:

Success:
: 2.02 "Deleted" or 204 "No Content" upon successful deletion

Failure:
: 4.04 "Not Found" or 404 "Not Found". Registration does not exist (e.g. may already have been removed).

The following examples shows successful removal of the endpoint from the RD with example location value /rd/4521.


~~~~
Req: DELETE /rd/4521

Res: 2.02 Deleted
~~~~
{: #example-removal title="Example of a registration removal" }


### Further operations {#link-up}

Additional operations on the registration can be specified in future documents, for example:

* Send iPATCH (or PATCH) updates ({{RFC8132}}) to add, remove or change the links of a registration.
* Use GET to read the currently stored set of links in a registration resource.

Those operations are out of scope of this document, and will require media types suitable for modifying sets of links.

### Request freshness {#freshness}

Some security mechanisms usable with an RD allow out of order request processing,
or do not even mandate replay protection at all.
The RD needs to ensure that operations on the registration resource
are executed in an order that does not distort the client's intentions.

This ordering of operations is expressed in terms of freshness as defined in {{I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag}}.
Requests that alter a resource's state need to be fresh relative to the latest request
that altered that state in a conflicting way.

An RD SHOULD determine a request's freshness,
and MUST use the Echo option if it requires request freshness and can not determine the it in any other way.
An endpoint MUST support the use of the Echo option.
(One reason why an RD would not require freshness is when no relevant registration properties are covered by is security policies.)

#### Efficient use of Echo by an RD

To keep latency and traffic added by the freshness requirements to a minimum,
RDs should avoid naïve (sufficient but inefficient) freshness criteria.

Some simple mechanisms the RD can employ are:

* State counter.
  The RD can keep a monotonous counter that increments whenever a registration changes.
  For every registration resource, it stores the post-increment value of that resource's last change.
  Requests altering them need to have at least that value encoded in their Echo option,
  and are otherwise rejected with a 4.01 Unauthorized and the current counter value as the Echo value.
  If other applications on the same server use Echo as well,
  that encoding may include a prefix indicating that it pertains to the RD's counter.

  The value associated with a resource needs to be kept across the removal of registrations
  if the same registration resource is to be reused.

  The counter can be reset (and the values of removed resources forgotten)
  when all previous security associations are reset.
  <!-- It can *also* be reset more frequently in an epoch based scheme, but that description is too large to fit in the margin. -->

  This is the "Persistent Counter" method of {{I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag}} Appendix A.

* Preemptive Echo values.
  The current state counter can be sent in an Echo option not only when requests are rejected with 4.01 Unauthorized,
  but also with successful responses.
  Thus, clients can be provided with Echo values sufficient for their next request on a regular basis.

  While endpoints may discard received Echo values at leisure between requests,
  they are encouraged to retain these values for the next request to avoid additional round trips.

* If the RD can ensure that only one security association has modifying access to any registration at any given time,
  and that security association provides order on the requests,
  that order is sufficient to show request freshness.

#### Examples of Echo usage

{{example-freshness}} shows the interactions of an endpoint
that has forgotten the server's latest Echo value
and temporarily reduces its registration lifetime:

~~~~
Req: POST /rd/4521?lt=7200

Res: 4.01 Unauthorized
Echo: 0x0123

(EP tries again immediately)

Req: POST /rd/4521?lt=7200
Echo: 0x0123

Res: 2.04 Changed
Echo: 0x0124

(Later the EP regains its confidence in its long-term reachability)

Req: POST /rd/4521?lt=90000
Echo: 0x0124

Res: 2.04 Changed
Echo: 0x0247
~~~~
{: #example-freshness title="Example update of a registration" }

The other examples do not show Echo options for simplicity,
and because they lack the context for any example values to have meaning.

# RD Lookup {#lookup}

To discover the resources registered with the RD,
a lookup interface must be provided. This lookup interface
is defined as a default, and it is assumed that RDs may also support lookups
to return resource descriptions in alternative formats (e.g. JSON or CBOR link format {{I-D.ietf-core-links-json}})
or using more advanced interfaces (e.g. supporting context or semantic
based lookup) on different resources that are discovered independently.

RD Lookup allows lookups for endpoints and resources
using attributes defined in this document and for use with the CoRE
Link Format. The result of a lookup request is the list of links (if any)
corresponding to the type of lookup.  Thus, an endpoint lookup MUST return a list of endpoints and a resource lookup MUST return a list of links to resources.

The lookup type is selected by a URI endpoint, which is indicated by a Resource Type as per {{lookup-types}} below:

| Lookup Type | Resource Type | Mandatory |
| Resource | core.rd-lookup-res | Mandatory |
| Endpoint | core.rd-lookup-ep | Mandatory |
{: #lookup-types title='Lookup Types'}

## Resource lookup

Resource lookup results in links that are semantically equivalent to the links submitted to the RD by the registrant.
The links and link parameters returned by the lookup are equal to the originally submitted ones,
except that the target reference is fully resolved,
and that the anchor reference is fully resolved if it is present in the lookup result at all.

Links that did not have an anchor attribute in the registration are returned without an anchor attribute.
Links of which href or anchor was submitted as a (full) URI are returned with the respective attribute unmodified.

The above rules allow the client to interpret the response as links without any further knowledge of the storage conventions of the RD.
The RD MAY replace the registration base URIs with a configured intermediate proxy, e.g. in the case of an HTTP lookup interface for CoAP endpoints.

If the base URI of a registration contains a link-local address,
the RD MUST NOT show its links unless the lookup was made from the
link on which the registered endpoint can be reached.
The RD MUST NOT include zone identifiers in the resolved URIs.


## Lookup filtering

Using the Accept Option, the requester can control whether the returned list is returned in CoRE Link Format (`application/link-format`, default) or in alternate content-formats (e.g. from {{I-D.ietf-core-links-json}}).

Multiple search criteria MAY be included in a lookup. All included criteria MUST match for a link to be returned. The RD MUST support matching with multiple search criteria.

A link matches a search criterion if it has an attribute of the same name and the same value, allowing for a trailing "\*" wildcard operator as in Section 4.1 of {{RFC6690}}.
Attributes that are defined as `relation-types` (in the link-format ABNF) match if the search value matches any of their values (see Section 4.1 of {{RFC6690}}; e.g. `?if=tag:example.net,2020:sensor` matches `;if="example.regname tag:example.net,2020:sensor";`).
A resource link also matches a search criterion if its endpoint would match the criterion, and vice versa, an endpoint link matches a search criterion if any of its resource links matches it.

Note that `href` is a valid search criterion and matches target references. Like all search criteria, on a resource lookup it can match the target reference of the resource link itself, but also the registration resource of the endpoint that registered it.
Queries for resource link targets MUST be in URI form (i.e. not relative references) and are matched against a resolved link target. Queries for endpoints SHOULD be expressed in path-absolute form if possible and MUST be expressed in URI form otherwise; the RD SHOULD recognize either.
The `anchor` attribute is usable for resource lookups, and, if queried, MUST be in URI form as well.

Additional query parameters "page" and "count" are used to obtain lookup results in specified increments using pagination, where count specifies how many links to return and page specifies which subset of links organized in sequential pages, each containing 'count' links, starting with link zero and page zero. Thus, specifying count of 10 and page of 0 will return the first 10 links in the result set (links 0-9). Count = 10 and page = 1 will return the next 'page' containing links 10-19, and so on.
Unlike block-wise transfer of a compelte result set,
these parameters ensure that each chunk of results can be interpreted on its own.
This simplifies the processing,
but can result in duplicate or missed items when coinciding with changes from the registration interface.

Endpoints that are interested in a lookup result repeatedly or continuously can use
mechanisms like ETag caching, resource observation ({{RFC7641}}),
or any future mechanism that might allow more efficient observations of collections.
These are advertised, detected and used according to their own specifications
and can be used with the lookup interface as with any other resource.

When resource observation is used,
every time the set of matching links changes, or the content of a matching link changes, the RD sends a notification with the matching link set.
The notification contains the successful current response to the given request,
especially with respect to representing zero matching links
(see "Success" item below).

The lookup interface is specified as follows:

Interaction:
: Client -> RD

Method:
: GET

URI Template:
: {+type-lookup-location}{?page,count,search\*}


URI Template Variables:
: type-lookup-location :=
  : RD Lookup URI for a given lookup type (mandatory). The address is
    discovered as described in {{discovery}}.

  search :=
  : Search criteria for limiting the number of results (optional).

  : The search criteria are an associative array, expressed in a form-style query as per the URI template (see {{RFC6570}} Sections 2.4.2 and 3.2.8)

  page :=
  : Page (optional). Parameter cannot be used without the count
    parameter. Results are returned from result set in pages that contain
    'count' links starting from index (page \* count). Page numbering starts
    with zero.

  count :=
  : Count (optional). Number of results is limited to this parameter value. If
    the page parameter is also present, the response MUST only include 'count'
    links starting with the (page \* count) link in the result set from the query. If
    the count parameter is not present, then the response MUST return all matching
    links in the result set. Link numbering starts with zero.

Accept:
: absent, application/link-format or any other indicated media type representing web links


The following responses codes are defined for this interface:

Success:
: 2.05 "Content" or 200 "OK" with an `application/link-format` or other web link payload containing matching entries for the lookup.

  The payload can contain zero links (which is an empty payload in {{RFC6690}} link format, but could also be `[]` in JSON based formats),
  indicating that no entities matched the request.


##  Resource lookup examples

The examples in this section assume the existence of CoAP hosts with a default CoAP port 61616. HTTP hosts are possible and do not change the nature of the examples.

{: #example-lookup-multiple title="Example of resource lookup from multiple endpoints" }

## Endpoint lookup {#ep-lookup}

The endpoint lookup returns links to and information about registration resources,
which themselves can only be manipulated by the registering endpoint.

Endpoint registration resources are annotated with their endpoint names (ep), sectors (d, if present) and registration base URI (base; reports the registrant-ep's address if no explicit base was given) as well as a constant resource type (rt="core.rd-ep"); the lifetime (lt) is not reported.
Additional endpoint attributes are added as target attributes to their endpoint link unless their specification says otherwise.

Links to endpoints SHOULD be presented in path-absolute form or, if required, as (full) URIs. (This ensures that the output conforms to Limited Link Format as described in {{limitedlinkformat}}.)

Base addresses that contain link-local addresses MUST NOT include zone identifiers,
and such registrations <!-- or "' base attributes" --> MUST NOT be
shown unless the lookup was made from the same link from which the
registration was made.

While Endpoint Lookup does expose the registration resources,
the RD does not need to make them accessible to clients.
Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to dereference or manipulate them.

An RD can report registrations in lookup whose URI scheme and authority differ from the lookup resource's.
Lookup clients MUST be prepared to see arbitrary URIs as registration resources in the results
and treat them as opaque identifiers;
the precise semantics of such links are left to future specifications.

The following example shows a client performing an endpoint lookup limited to endpoints of endpoint type `tag:example.com,2020:platform`:

~~~~
Req: GET /rd-lookup/ep?et=tag:example.com,2020:platform

Res: 2.05 Content

{: #example-lookup-ep title="Examples of endpoint lookup" }


# Security policies {#policies}

The security policies that are applicable to an RD strongly depend on the application,
and are not set out normatively here.

This section provides a list of aspects that applications should consider when describing their use of the RD,
without claiming to cover all cases.
It is using terminology of {{I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz}},
in which the RD acts as the Resource Server (RS), and both registrant-eps and lookup clients act as Clients (C) with support from an Authorization Server (AS),
without the intention of ruling out other (e.g. certificate / public-key infrastructure (PKI) based) schemes.

Any, all or none of the below can apply to an application.
Which are relevant depends on its protection objectives.

Security policies are set by configuration of the RD, or by choice of the implementation.
Lookup clients (and, where relevant, endpoints) can only trust an RD to uphold them if it is authenticated,
and authorized to serve as an RD according to the application's requirements.

## Endpoint name {#secure-ep}

Whenever an RD needs to provide trustworthy results to clients doing endpoint lookup,
or resource lookup with filtering on the endpoint name,
the RD must ensure that the registrant is authorized to use the given endpoint name.
This applies both to registration and later to operations on the registration resource.
It is immaterial whether the client is the registrant-ep itself or a CT is doing the registration:
The RD cannot tell the difference, and CTs may use authorization credentials authorizing only operations on that particular endpoint name, or a wider range of endpoint names.

It is up to the concrete security policy to describe
how endpoint name and sector are transported when certificates are used.
For example, it may describe how SubjectAltName dNSName entries are mapped to endpoint and domain names.

### Random endpoint names {#arbitrary-ep}

Conversely, in applications where the RD does not check the endpoint name,
the authorized registering endpoint can generate a random number (or string) that identifies the endpoint.
The RD should then remember unique properties of the registrant,
associate them with the registration for as long as its registration resource is active (which may be longer than the registration's lifetime),
and require the same properties for operations on the registration resource.

Registrants that are prepared to pick a different identifier when their initial attempt
(or attempts, in the unlikely case of two subsequent collisions)
at registration is unauthorized should pick an identifier at least twice as long as the expected number of registrants;
registrants without such a recovery options should pick significantly longer endpoint names (e.g. using UUID URNs {{?RFC4122}}).

## Entered resources {#entered-resources}

When lookup clients expect that certain types of links can only originate from certain endpoints,
then the RD needs to apply filtering to the links an endpoint may register.

For example, if clients use an RD to find a server that provides firmware updates,
then any registrant that wants to register (or update) links to firmware sources will need to provide suitable credentials to do so, independently of its endpoint name.

Note that the impact of having undesirable links in the RD depends on the application:
if the client requires the firmware server to present credentials as a firmware server,
a fraudulent link's impact is limited to the client revealing its intention to obtain updates and slowing down the client until it finds a legitimate firmware server;
if the client accepts any credentials from the server as long as they fit the provided URI, the impact is larger.

An RD may also require that links are only registered if the registrant is authorized to publish information about the anchor (or even target) of the link.
One way to do this is to demand that the registrant present the same credentials as a client that they'd need to present if contacted as a server at the resources' URI, which may include using the address and port that are part of the URI.
Such a restriction places severe practical limitations on the links that can be registered.

As above, the impact of undesirable links depends on the extent to which the lookup client relies on the RD.
To avoid the limitations, RD applications should consider <!-- can we pull in RFC6919 to make this normative? --> prescribing that lookup clients only use the discovered information as hints,
and describe which pieces of information need to be verified because they impact the application's security.
A straightforward way to verify such information is to request it again from an authorized server, typically the one that hosts the target resource.
That similar to what happens in {{discovery}} when the URI discovery step is repeated.

## Link confidentiality {#link-confidentiality}

When registrants publish information in the RD that is not available to any client that would query the registrant's /.well-known/core interface,
or when lookups to that interface are subject so stricter firewalling than lookups to the RD,
the RD may need to limit which lookup clients may access the information.

In this case, the endpoint (and not the lookup clients) needs to be careful to check the RD's authorization.
The RD needs to check any lookup client's authorization
before revealing information directly (in resource lookup)
or indirectly (when using it to satisfy a resource lookup search criterion).

## Segmentation

Within a single RD, different security policies can apply.

One example of this are multi-tenant deployments separated by the sector (d) parameter.
Some sectors might apply limitations on the endpoint names available,
while others use a random identifier approach to endpoint names and place limits on the entered links based on their attributes instead.

Care must be taken in such setups to determine the applicable access control measures to each operation.
One easy way to do that is to mandate the use of the sector parameter on all operations,
as no credentials are suitable for operations across sector borders anyway.

## First-Come-First-Remembered: A default policy

The First-Come-First-Remembered policy is provided both as a reference example for a security policy definition,
and as a policy that implementations may choose to use as default policy in absence of other configuration.
It is designed to enable efficient discovery operations even in ad-hoc settings.

Under this policy, the RD accepts registrations for any endpoint name that is not assigned to an active registration resource,
and only accepts registration updates from the same endpoint.
The policy is minimal in that towards lookup clients it does not make any of the claims of {{entered-resources}} and {{link-confidentiality}},
and its claims on {{secure-ep}} are limited to the lifetime of that endpoint's registration.
It does, however, guarantee towards any endpoint that for the duration of its registration, its links will be discoverable on the RD.

When a registration or operation is attempted, the RD MUST determine the client's subject name or public key:

* If the client's credentials indicate any subject name that is certified by any authority which the RD recognizes (which may be the system's trust anchor store), all such subject names are stored.
  With CWT or JWT based credentials (as common with ACE), the Subject (sub) claim is stored as a single name, if it exists.
  With X.509 certificates, the Common Name (CN) and the complete list of SubjectAltName entries are stored.
  In both cases, the authority that certified the claim is stored along with the subject, as the latter may only be locally unique.
* Otherwise, if the client proves possession of a private key, the matching public key is stored.
  This applies both to raw public keys and to the public keys indicated in certificates that failed the above authority check.
* If neither is present, a reference to the security session itself is stored.
  With (D)TLS, that is the connection itself, or the session resumption information if available.
  With OSCORE, that is the security context.

As part of the registration operation, that information is stored along with the registration resource.

The RD MUST accept all registrations whose registration resource is not already active,
as long as they are made using a security layer supported by the RD.

Any operation on a registration resource,
including registrations that lead to an existing registration resource,
MUST be rejected by the RD unless all the stored information is found in the new request's credentials.

Note that even though subject names are compared in this policy,
they are never directly compared to endpoint names,
and an endpoint can not expect to "own" any particular endpoint name outside of an active registration --
even if a certificate says so.
It is an accepted shortcoming of this approach that the endpoint has no indication of whether the RD remembers it by its subject name or public key;
recognition by subject happens on a best-effort base (given the RD may not recognize any authority).
Clients MUST be prepared to pick a different endpoint name when rejected by the RD initially or after a change in their credentials;
picking an endpoint name as per {{arbitrary-ep}} is an easy option for that.

For this policy to be usable without configuration, clients should not set a sector name in their registrations.
An RD can set a default sector name for registrations accepted under this policy,
which is useful especially in a segmented setup where different policies apply to different sectors.
The configuration of such a behavior, as well as any other configuration applicable to such an RD
(i.e. the set of recognized authorities)
is out of scope for this document.

# Security Considerations

The security considerations as described in Section 5 of {{RFC8288}} and
Section 6 of {{RFC6690}} apply. The `/.well-known/core` resource may be
protected e.g. using DTLS when hosted on a CoAP server as described in
{{RFC7252}}.

Access that is limited or affects sensitive data SHOULD be protected,
e.g. using (D)TLS or OSCORE ({{?RFC8613}};
which aspects of the RD this affects depends on the security policies of the application (see {{policies}}).

## Discovery {#seccons-discovery}

Most steps in discovery of the RD, and possibly its resources, are not covered by CoAP's security mechanisms.
This will not endanger the security properties of the registrations and lookup itself
(where the client requires authorization of the RD if it expects any security properties of the operation),
but may leak the client's intention to third parties,
and allow them to slow down the process.

To mitigate that, clients can retain the RD's address,
use secure discovery options like configured addresses,
and send queries for RDs in a very general form (`?rt=core.rd*` rather than `?rt=core.rd-lookup-ep`).

## Endpoint Identification and Authentication {#endpoint_identification}

An Endpoint (name, sector) pair is unique within the set of endpoints registered by the RD. An Endpoint MUST NOT be identified by its protocol, port or IP
address as these may change over the lifetime of an Endpoint.

Every operation performed by an Endpoint on an RD
SHOULD be mutually authenticated using Pre-Shared Key, Raw Public Key or
Certificate based security.

Consider the following threat: two devices A and B are registered at a single server. Both devices have unique, per-device credentials for use with DTLS to make sure that only parties with authorization to access A or B can do so.

Now, imagine that a malicious device A wants to sabotage the device B. It uses its credentials during the DTLS exchange. Then, it specifies the
endpoint name of device B as the name of its own endpoint in device A. If the server does not check
whether the identifier provided in the DTLS handshake matches the
identifier used at the CoAP layer then it may be inclined to use the
endpoint name for looking up what information to provision to the malicious device.

Endpoint authorization needs to be checked on registration and registration resource operations
independently of whether there are configured requirements on the credentials for a given endpoint name (and sector; {{secure-ep}})
or whether arbitrary names are accepted ({{arbitrary-ep}}).

Simple registration could be used to circumvent address-based access control:
An attacker would send a simple registration request with the victim's address as source address,
and later look up the victim's /.well-known/core content in the RD.
Mitigation for this is recommended in {{simple}}.

The registration resource path is visible to any client that is allowed endpoint lookup,
and can be extracted by resource lookup clients as well.
The same goes for registration attributes that are shown as target attributes or lookup attributes.
The RD needs to consider this in the choice of registration resource paths,
and administrators or endpoint in their choice of attributes.

## Access Control

Access control SHOULD be performed separately for the RD registration and Lookup
API paths, as different endpoints may be authorized to register
with an RD from those authorized to lookup endpoints from the RD. Such access
control SHOULD be performed in as fine-grained a level as possible. For example
access control for lookups could be performed either at the sector, endpoint
or resource level.

The precise access controls necessary (and the consequences of failure to enforce them)
depend on the protection objectives of the application and the security policies ({{policies}}) derived from them.

## Denial of Service Attacks

Services that run over UDP unprotected are vulnerable to unknowingly
amplify and distribute a DoS attack as UDP does not require return
routability check.
Since RD lookup responses can be significantly
larger than requests, RDs are prone to this.

{{RFC7252}} describes this at length in its Section 11.3,
including some mitigation by using small block sizes in responses.
The upcoming {{I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag}} updates that
by describing a source address verification mechanism using the Echo option.

\[ If this document is published together with or after I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag,
the above paragraph is replaced with the following:

{{RFC7252}} describes this at length in its Section 11.3,
and {{I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag}} (which updates the former)
recommends using the Echo option to verify the request's source address.

\]

## Skipping freshness checks

When RD based applications are built in which request freshness checks are not performed,
these concerns need to be balanced:

* When alterations to registration attributes are reordered,
  an attacker may create any combination of attributes ever set,
  with the attack difficulty determined by the security layer's replay properties.

  For example, if {{example-freshness}} were conducted without freshness assurances,
  an attacker could later reset the lifetime back to 7200.
  <!-- That is, with DTLS without replay protection, or DTLS when causing a retransmission and swallowing one message,
  or with OSCORE when swallowing all of an update's retransmission but the ep later tries again. -->
  Thus, the device is made unreachable to lookup clients.

* When registration updates without query parameters
  (which just serve to restart the lifetime)
  can be reordered,
  an attacker can use intercepted messages to give the appearance of the device being alive to the RD.

  This is unacceptable when when the RD's security policy promises reachability of endpoints
  (e.g. when disappearing devices would trigger further investigation),
  but may be acceptable with other policies.

# IANA Considerations

## Resource Types {#iana-rt}

IANA is asked to enter the following values into the Resource Type (rt=) Link
Target Attribute Values sub-registry of the Constrained Restful Environments
(CoRE) Parameters registry defined in {{RFC6690}}:

| Value               | Description                           | Reference              |
| core.rd             | Directory resource of an RD           | RFCTHIS {{discovery}} |
| core.rd-lookup-res  | Resource lookup of an RD              | RFCTHIS {{discovery}} |
| core.rd-lookup-ep   | Endpoint lookup of an RD              | RFCTHIS {{discovery}} |
| core.rd-ep          | Endpoint resource of an RD            | RFCTHIS {{lookup}}    |


## IPv6 ND Resource Directory Address Option

This document registers one new ND option type under the sub-registry "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats"
of the "Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters" registry:

* Resource Directory Address Option (TBD38)

\[ The RFC editor is asked to replace TBD38
with the assigned number in the document;
the value 38 is suggested. \]

## RD Parameter Registry {#iana-registry}

This specification defines a new sub-registry for registration and lookup
parameters called "RD Parameters" under "CoRE Parameters". Although this
specification defines a basic set of parameters, it is expected that other
standards that make use of this interface will define new ones.

Each entry in the registry must include

* the human readable name of the parameter,
* the short name as used in query parameters or target attributes,
* indication of whether it can be passed as a query parameter at registration of endpoints, as a query parameter in lookups, or be expressed as a target attribute,
* syntax and validity requirements if any,
* a description,
* and a link to reference documentation.

The query parameter MUST be both a valid URI query key {{RFC3986}} and a token as used in {{RFC8288}}.

The description must give details on whether the parameter can be updated, and how it is to be processed in lookups.

The mechanisms around new RD parameters should be designed in such a way that they tolerate RD implementations that are unaware of the parameter and expose any parameter passed at registration or updates on in endpoint lookups. (For example, if a parameter used at registration were to be confidential, the registering endpoint should be instructed to only set that parameter if the RD advertises support for keeping it confidential at the discovery step.)

Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

| Full name             | Short | Validity           | Use | Description                                                             |
| Endpoint Name         | ep    | Unicode*           | RLA | Name of the endpoint                                                    |
| Lifetime              | lt    | 1-4294967295       | R   | Lifetime of the registration in seconds                                 |
| Sector                | d     | Unicode*           | RLA | Sector to which this endpoint belongs                                   |
| Registration Base URI | base  | URI                | RLA | The scheme, address and port and path at which this server is available |
| Page                  | page  | Integer            |  L  | Used for pagination                                                     |
| Count                 | count | Integer            |  L  | Used for pagination                                                     |
| Endpoint Type         | et    | {{et-description}} | RLA | Semantic type of the endpoint (see {{et-registry}})                     |
{: #tab-registry title='RD Parameters' }

(Short: Short name used in query parameters or target attributes. Validity: Unicode* = 63 Bytes of UTF-8 encoded Unicode, with no control characters as per {{registration}}. Use: R = used at registration, L = used at lookup, A = expressed in target attribute.)

The descriptions for the options defined in this document are only summarized here.
To which registrations they apply and when they are to be shown is described in the respective sections of this document.
All their reference documentation entries point to this document.

The IANA policy for future additions to the sub-registry is "Expert Review"
as described in {{RFC8126}}. The evaluation should consider
formal criteria,
duplication of functionality (Is the new entry redundant with an existing one?),
topical suitability (E.g. is the described property actually a property of the endpoint and not a property of a particular resource, in which case it should go into the payload of the registration and need not be registered?),
and the potential for conflict with commonly used target attributes (For example, `if` could be used as a parameter for conditional registration if it were not to be used in lookup or attributes, but would make a bad parameter for lookup, because a resource lookup with an `if` query parameter could ambiguously filter by the registered endpoint property or the {{RFC6690}} target attribute).

### Full description of the "Endpoint Type" RD Parameter {#et-description}

An endpoint registering at an RD can describe itself with endpoint types,
similar to how resources are described with Resource Types in {{RFC6690}}.
An endpoint type is expressed as a string, which can be either a URI or one of
the values defined in the Endpoint Type sub-registry.
Endpoint types can be passed in the `et` query parameter as part of extra-attrs
at the Registration step,
are shown on endpoint lookups using the `et` target attribute,
and can be filtered for using `et` as a search criterion in resource and
endpoint lookup.
Multiple endpoint types are given as separate query parameters or link
attributes.

Note that Endpoint Type differs from Resource Type in that it uses multiple
attributes rather than space separated values.
As a result, RDs implementing this specification automatically support correct
filtering in the lookup interfaces from the rules for unknown endpoint
attributes.

## "Endpoint Type" (et=) RD Parameter values {#et-registry}

This specification establishes a new sub-registry under "CoRE Parameters"
called '"Endpoint Type" (et=) RD Parameter values'.
The registry properties (required policy, requirements, template) are identical
to those of the Resource Type parameters in {{RFC6690}}, in short:

The review policy is IETF Review for values starting with "core", and
Specification Required for others.

The requirements to be enforced are:

* The values MUST be related to the purpose described in {{et-description}}.

* The registered values MUST conform to the ABNF reg-rel-type definition of
  {{RFC6690}} and MUST NOT be a URI.

* It is recommended to use the period "." character for segmentation.

The registry initially contains one value:

 * "core.rd-group": An application group as described in {{groups}}.


## Multicast Address Registration {#mc-registration}

   <!-- IANA has assigned -->
   IANA is asked to assign
   the following multicast addresses for use by CoAP nodes:

   IPv4  -- "all CoRE Resource Directories" address MCD2 (suggestion: 224.0.1.189), from the "IPv4
      Multicast Address Space Registry".  As the address is used for
      discovery that may span beyond a single network, it has come from
      the Internetwork Control Block (224.0.1.x) {{?RFC5771}}.

   IPv6  -- "all CoRE Resource Directories" address MCD1 (suggestions FF0X::FE), from the "IPv6 Multicast
      Address Space Registry", in the "Variable Scope Multicast
      Addresses" space (RFC 3307).  Note that there is a distinct
      multicast address for each scope that interested CoAP nodes should
      listen to; CoAP needs the Link-Local and Site-Local scopes only.

\[ The RFC editor is asked to replace MCD1 and MCD2
with the assigned addresses throughout the document. \]

## Well-Known URIs

IANA is asked to permanently register
<!-- IANA has permanently registered -->
the URI suffix "rd"
in the "Well-Known URIs" registry.
The change controller is the IETF,
this document is the reference.

## Service Names and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry

IANA is asked to enter four new items into the Service Names and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry:

* Service name: "core-rd",  Protocol: "udp", Description: "Resource Directory accessed using CoAP"
* Service name "core-rd-dtls", Protocol: "udp", Description: "Resource Directory accessed using CoAP over DTLS"
* Service name: "core-rd",  Protocol: "tcp", Description: "Resource Directory accessed using CoAP over TCP"
* Service name "core-rd-tls", Protocol: "tcp", Description: "Resource Directory accessed using CoAP over TLS"

All in common have this document as their reference.

# Examples {#examples}

Two examples are presented: a Lighting Installation example in {{lt-ex}} and a LwM2M example in {{lwm2m-ex}}.

## Lighting Installation {#lt-ex}

This example shows a simplified lighting installation which makes use of
the RD with a CoAP interface to facilitate the installation and start-up of
the application code in the lights and sensors. In particular, the example
leads to the definition of a group and the enabling of the corresponding
multicast address as described in {{groups}}. No conclusions must be drawn on the realization of actual
installation or naming procedures, because the example only "emphasizes" some of the issues
that may influence the use of the RD and does not pretend to be normative.

### Installation Characteristics {#lt-in-ch}

The example assumes that the installation is managed. That means that a Commissioning
Tool (CT) is used to authorize the addition of nodes, name them, and name
their services. The CT can be connected to the installation in many ways:
the CT can be part of the installation network, connected by WiFi to the
installation network, or connected via GPRS link, or other method.

It is assumed that there are two naming authorities for the installation:
(1) the network manager that is responsible for the correct operation of
the network and the connected interfaces, and (2) the lighting manager that
is responsible for the correct functioning of networked lights and sensors.
The result is the existence of two naming schemes coming from the two managing
entities.

The example installation consists of one presence sensor, and two luminaries,
luminary1 and luminary2, each with their own wireless interface. Each luminary
contains three lamps: left, right and middle. Each luminary is accessible
through one endpoint. For each lamp a resource exists to modify the settings
of a lamp in a luminary. The purpose of the installation is that the presence
sensor notifies the presence of persons to a group of lamps. The group of
lamps consists of: middle and left lamps of luminary1 and right lamp of luminary2.

Before commissioning by the lighting manager, the network is installed and
access to the interfaces is proven to work by the network manager.

At the moment of installation, the network under installation is not necessarily
connected to the DNS infrastructure. Therefore, SLAAC IPv6 addresses are
assigned to CT, RD, luminaries and the sensor.
The addresses shown in {{interface-S}} below stand in for these in the following examples.

| Name | IPv6 address |
| luminary1 | 2001:db8:4::1 |
| luminary2 | 2001:db8:4::2 |
| Presence sensor | 2001:db8:4::3 |
| RD | 2001:db8:4::ff |
{: #interface-S title='Addresses used in the examples'}

In {{rd-en}} the use of RD during installation is
presented.


### RD entries {#rd-en}

It is assumed that access to the DNS infrastructure is not always possible
during installation. Therefore, the SLAAC addresses are used in this section.

For discovery, the resource types (rt) of the devices are important. The
lamps in the luminaries have rt=tag:example.com,2020:light, and the presence sensor has rt=tag:example.com,2020:p-sensor.
The endpoints have names which are relevant to the light installation manager.
In this case luminary1, luminary2, and the presence sensor are located in
room 2-4-015, where luminary1 is located at the window and luminary2 and
the presence sensor are located at the door. The endpoint names reflect
this physical location. The middle, left and right lamps are accessed via
path /light/middle, /light/left, and /light/right respectively. The identifiers
relevant to the RD are shown in {{endpoint}} below:

| Name | endpoint | resource path | resource type |
| luminary1 | lm_R2-4-015_wndw  | /light/left  |  tag:example.com,2020:light  |
| luminary1 | lm_R2-4-015_wndw  | /light/middle  |  tag:example.com,2020:light  |
| luminary1 | lm_R2-4-015_wndw  | /light/right  |  tag:example.com,2020:light  |
| luminary2 | lm_R2-4-015_door  | /light/left  |  tag:example.com,2020:light  |
| luminary2 | lm_R2-4-015_door  | /light/middle  |  tag:example.com,2020:light  |
| luminary2 | lm_R2-4-015_door  | /light/right  |  tag:example.com,2020:light  |
| Presence sensor | ps_R2-4-015_door  | /ps  |  tag:example.com,2020:p-sensor  |
{: #endpoint title='RD identifiers'}

It is assumed that the CT has performed RD discovery and has received a response like the one in the {{discovery}} example.

The CT inserts the endpoints of the luminaries and the sensor in the RD
using the registration base URI parameter (base) to specify the interface address:

The sector name d=R2-4-015 has been added for an efficient lookup because
filtering on "ep" name is more awkward. The same sector name is communicated to
the two luminaries and the presence sensor by the CT.

The group is specified in the RD. The base parameter is set to the site-local
multicast address allocated to the group.
In the POST in the example below, the resources supported by all group members are published.

{: #example-lighting-2 title="Example of a multicast group a CT enters into an RD" }

After the filling of the RD by the CT, the application in the luminaries
can learn to which groups they belong, and enable their interface for the
multicast address.

The luminary, knowing its sector and being configured to join any group
containing lights, searches for candidate groups and joins them:

~~~~
Req: GET coap://[2001:db8:4::ff]/rd-lookup/ep
  ?d=R2-4-015&et=core.rd-group&rt=light

~~~~
{: #example-lighting-3 title="Example of a lookup exchange to find suitable multicast addresses" }

From the returned base parameter value, the luminary learns the multicast address
of the multicast group.

The presence sensor can learn the presence of groups that support resources with rt=tag:example.com,2020:light in its own sector by sending the same request, as used by the luminary. The presence sensor learns the multicast address to use for sending messages to the luminaries.

## OMA Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) {#lwm2m-ex}

OMA LwM2M is a profile for device services based on CoAP, providing interfaces and operations for device management and device service enablement.

An LwM2M server is an instance of an LwM2M middleware service layer, containing an RD ({{LwM2M}} page 36f).

That RD only implements the registration interface, and no lookup is implemented.
Instead, the LwM2M server provides access to the registered resources, in a similar way to a reverse proxy.

The location of the LwM2M Server and RD URI path is provided by the LwM2M Bootstrap process, so no dynamic discovery of the RD is used. LwM2M Servers and endpoints are not required to implement the /.well-known/core resource.

# Changelog

changes from -27 to -28

* Security policies / link confidentiality: Point out the RD's obligations that follow from such a policy.

* Simple registration: clarify term "regular registration" by introducing it along with the reference to {{registration}}

* Wording fix in first-come-first-remembered

* Wording fixes in RD definition

* Capitalization: Consistently using "registration resource"

changes from -26 to -27

* In general, this addresses the points that were pointed out in
  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/xWLomwwhovkU-CPGNxnvs40BhaM/ as
  having "evolved from the review comments being discussed in the interim
  meetings", and the review comments from Esko Dijk that were largely entangled
  in these points.

* Relaxation of the serialization rules for link-format

  The interpretation of RFC6690 used in {{resolution-rules}} was shown to be faulty.
  Along with a correction, the common implementations of link-format were surveyed again
  and it was found that the only one that employed the faulty interpretation can still safely be upgraded.
  These were removed from the set considered for Limited Link Format,
  making the set of valid Limited Link Format documents larger.

  As a consequence, the prescribed serialization of RD output can be roughly halved in bytes.

  There might be additional usage patterns that are possible with the new set of constraints,
  but there is insufficient implementation and deployment experience with them to warrant a change changes on that front at this point.
  The specification can later be extended compatibly to allow these cases and drop the requirement of Limited Link Format.

* Add Request freshness subsection

  It is now recommended (with security considerations on consequences of not doing it) to require ordering of RD operations.

  The Echo mechanism (previously suggested in various places but never exclusively) is the one prescribed way of getting this ordering,
  making the echo-request-tag reference normative.

* Improved expression about when an RD needs to verify simple registration.

  The simple wording missed the authorization part, and did not emphasize that this is a per-deployment property.

* Point out the non-atomic properties of paginated access.

* Clarification around impl-info reference.

* Inconsistencies and extraneous quotings removed from examples.

changes from -25 to -26

* Security policies:
  * The First-Come-First-Remembered policy is added as an example and a potential default behavior.
  * Clarify that the mapping between endpoint names and subject fields is up to a policy that defines reliance on names, and give an example.
  * Random EP names: Point that multiple collisions are possible but unlikely.
  * Add pointers to policies:
    * RD replication: Point out that policies may limit that.
    * Registration: Reword (ep, d) mapping to a previous registration's resource that could have been read as another endpoint taking over an existing registration.
  * Clarify that the security policy is a property of the RD the any client may need to verify by checking the RD's authorization.
  * Clarify how information from an untrusted RD can be verified
  * Remove speculation about how in detail ACE scopes are obtained.

* Security considerations:
  * Generalize to all current options for security layers usable with CoAP (OSCORE was
    missing as the text predated RFC8613)
  * Relax the previous SHOULD on secure access to SHOULD where protection is indicated by security policies
    (bringing the text in line with the -25 changes)
  * Point out that failure to follow the security considerations has implications depending on the protection objective described with the security policies
  * Shorten amplification mitigation
  * Add note about information in Registration Resource path.
  * Acknowledge that most host discovery operations are not secured; mention consequences and mitigation.

* Abstract, introduction: removed "or disperse networks"

* RD discovery:
  * Drop the previously stated assumption that RDAO and any DHCP options would only be used together with SLAAC and DHCP for address configuration, respectivly.
  * Give concrete guidance for address selection based on RFC6724 when responding to multicasts
  * RDAO:
    * Clarify that it is an option for RAs and not other ND messages.
    * Change Lifetime from 16-bit minutes to 32-bit seconds and swap it with Reserved (aligning it with RDNSS which it shares other properties as well).
  * Point out that clients may need to check RD authorization already in last discovery step

* Registration:
  * Wording around "mostly mandatory" has been improved, conflicts clarified and sector default selection adjusted.

* Simple registration: Rather than coopting POSTs to /.well-known/core, a new resource /.well-known/rd is registered.
  A historical note in the text documents the change.

* Examples:
  * Use example URIs rather than unclear reg names (unless it's RFC6690 examples, which were kept for continuity)
  * The LwM2M example was reduced from an outdated explanation of the complete LwM2M model to a summary of how RD is used in there, with a reference to the current specification.
  * Luminary example: Explain example addresses
  * Luminary example: Drop reference to coap-group mechanism that's becoming obsolete, and thus also to RFC7390
  * Multicast addresses in the examples were changed from ff35:30:2001:db8::x to ff35:30:2001:db8:f1::8000:x; the 8000 is to follow RFC 3307, and the f1 is for consistency with all the other example addresses where 2001:db8::/32 is subnetted to 2001:db8:x::/48 by groups of internally consistent examples.

* Use case text enhancements
  * Home and building automation: Tie in with RD
  * M2M: Move system design paragraph towards the topic of reusability.

* Various editorial fixes in response to Gen-ART and IESG reviews.

* Rename 'Full description of the "Endpoint Type" Registration Parameter' section to '... RD Parameter'

* Terminology: Clarify that the CTs' installation events can occur multiple times.

* Promote RFCs 7252, 7230 and 8288 to normative references

* Moved Christian Amsüss to first author


changes from -24 to -25


* Large rework of section 7 (Security policies)

  Rather than prescribing which data in the RD *is* authenticated (and how),
  it now describes what applications built on an RD *can* choose to authenticate,
  show possibilities on how to do it and outline what it means for clients.

  This addresses Russ' Genart review points on details in the text in a rather broad fashion.
  That is because the discussion on the topic inside the WG showed that that text on security has been driven more review-by-review than by an architectural plan of the authors and WG.

* Add concrete suggestions (twice as long as registrant number with retries, or UUIDs without) for random endpoint names

* Point out that simple registration can have faked origins,
  RECOMMEND mitigation when applicable
  and suggest the Echo mechanism to implement it.

* Reshuffling of sections: Move additional operations and endpoint lookup back
  from appendix, and groups into one
* Lookup interface tightened to not imply applicability for non link-format

# Groups Registration and Lookup {#groups}

The RD-Groups usage pattern allows announcing application groups inside an RD.

Groups are represented by endpoint registrations.
Their base address is a multicast address,
and they SHOULD be entered with the endpoint type `core.rd-group`.
The endpoint name can also be referred to as a group name in this context.

The registration is inserted into the RD by a Commissioning Tool,
which might also be known as a group manager here.
It performs third party registration and registration updates.

The links it registers SHOULD be available on all members that join the group.
Depending on the application, members that lack some resource
MAY be permissible if requests to them fail gracefully.


The following example shows a CT registering a group with the name “lights” which provides two resources.
The directory resource path /rd
is an example RD location discovered in a request similar to {{example-discovery}}.
The group address in the example is constructed from {{?RFC3849}}'s reserved 2001:db8:: prefix as a unicast-prefix based site-local address (see {{?RFC3306}}.

~~~~
Req: POST coap://rd.example.com/rd?ep=lights&et=core.rd-group
                           &base=coap://[ff35:30:2001:db8:f1::8000:1]

Payload:
</light>;rt="tag:example.com,2020:light";

Res: 2.01 Created
Location-Path: /rd/12
~~~~
{: #example-group-registration title="Example registration of a group"}

In this example, the group manager can easily permit devices that have no
writable color-temperature to join, as they would still respond to brightness
changing commands. Had the group instead contained a single resource that sets
brightness and color temperature atomically, endpoints would need to support
both properties.

The resources of a group can be looked up like any other resource,
and the group registrations (along with any additional registration parameters)
can be looked up using the endpoint lookup interface.


The following example shows a client performing an endpoint lookup for all groups.

Req: GET /rd-lookup/ep?et=core.rd-group

# Web links and the Resource Directory {#weblink}

Understanding the semantics of a link-format document and its URI references is
a journey through different documents ({{RFC3986}} defining URIs, {{RFC6690}}
defining link-format documents based on {{RFC8288}} which defines Link header fields,
and {{RFC7252}} providing the transport). This appendix summarizes
the mechanisms and semantics at play from an entry in `/.well-known/core` to a
resource lookup.

This text is primarily aimed at people entering the field of Constrained
Restful Environments from applications that previously did not use web
mechanisms.

## A simple example

Let's start this example with a very simple host, `2001:db8:f0::1`. A client
that follows classical CoAP Discovery ({{RFC7252}} Section 7), sends the
following multicast request to learn about neighbours supporting resources with
resource-type "temperature".

The client sends a link-local multicast:

~~~~
Req: GET coap://[ff02::fd]:5683/.well-known/core?rt=temperature

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
</sensors/temp>;rt=temperature;ct=0
~~~~
{: #example-weblink-wkc title="Example of direct resource discovery"}

where the response is sent by the server, `[2001:db8:f0::1]:5683`.

While the client -- on the practical or implementation side -- can just go
ahead and create a new request to `[2001:db8:f0::1]:5683` with Uri-Path:
`sensors` and `temp`, the full resolution steps for insertion into and retrieval from the RD without any shortcuts are:

### Resolving the URIs {#resolveURI}

The client parses the single returned record. The link's target (sometimes
called "href") is "`/sensors/temp`", which is a relative URI that needs resolving.
The base
URI <coap://[ff02::fd]:5683/.well-known/core> is used to resolve the
reference /sensors/temp against.

The Base URI of the requested resource can be composed from the options of the CoAP GET request by following the steps of
{{RFC7252}} section 6.5 (with an addition at the end of 8.2) into
"`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/.well-known/core`".

Because "`/sensors/temp`" starts with a single slash,
the record's target is resolved by replacing the path "`/.well-known/core`"
from the Base URI (section 5.2 {{RFC3986}}) with the relative target URI "`/sensors/temp`" into
"`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp`".

### Interpreting attributes and relations

Some more information but the record's target can be obtained from the payload:
the resource type of the target is "temperature", and its content format is
text/plain (ct=0).

A relation in a web link is a three-part statement that specifies a named relation between the so-called "context resource"
and the target resource, like "*This page* has *its table
of contents* at */toc.html*". In link format documents,
there is an implicit "host relation" specified with default parameter: rel="hosts".

In our example, the context resource of the link is implied to be "coap:://[2001:db8:f0::1]"
by the default value of the anchor (see {{resolution-rules}}).
A full English expression of the "host relation" is:

'`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]` is hosting the resource
`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp`, which is of the resource type "temperature" and
can be accessed using the text/plain content format.'

## A slightly more complex example

Omitting the `rt=temperature` filter, the discovery query would
have given some more records in the payload:

~~~~
Req: GET coap://[ff02::fd]:5683/.well-known/core

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
</sensors/temp>;rt=temperature;ct=0,
</sensors/light>;rt=light-lux;ct=0,
</t>;anchor="/sensors/temp";rel=alternate,
<http://www.example.com/sensors/t123>;anchor="/sensors/temp";
    rel=describedby
~~~~
{: #example-weblink-wkc-extended title="Extended example of direct resource discovery"}

Parsing the third record, the client encounters the "anchor" parameter. It is
a URI relative to the Base URI of the request and is thus resolved to
"`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp`".
That is the context resource of the link, so the "rel" statement is not about
the target and the Base URI any more, but about the target and the resolved
URI. Thus, the third record could be read as
"`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp` has an alternate representation at
`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/t`".

Following the same resolution steps, the fourth record can be read as "`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp` is
described by `http://www.example.com/sensors/t123`".

## Enter the Resource Directory

The RD tries to carry the semantics obtainable by classical
CoAP discovery over to the resource lookup interface as faithfully as possible.

For the following queries, we will assume that the simple host has used Simple
Registration to register at the RD that was announced to it,
sending this request from its UDP port `[2001:db8:f0::1]:6553`:

~~~~
Req: POST coap://[2001:db8:f01::ff]/.well-known/rd?ep=simple-host1

Res: 2.04 Changed
~~~~
{: #example-weblink-simple title="Example of a simple registration"}

The RD would have accepted the registration, and queried the
simple host's `/.well-known/core` by itself. As a result, the host is registered
as an endpoint in the RD with the name "simple-host1". The registration is
active for 90000 seconds, and the endpoint registration Base URI is
"`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]`" following the resolution steps described in {{resolveURI}}. It should be remarked that the Base URI constructed that way always yields a URI of the form: scheme://authority without path suffix.

If the client now queries the RD as it would previously have issued a multicast
request, it would go through the RD discovery steps by fetching
`coap://[2001:db8:f0::ff]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd-lookup-res`, obtain
`coap://[2001:db8:f0::ff]/rd-lookup/res` as the resource lookup endpoint, and
ask it for all temperature resources:

~~~~
Req: GET coap://[2001:db8:f0::ff]/rd-lookup/res?rt=temperature

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
<coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp>;rt=temperature;ct=0
~~~~
{: #example-weblink-lookup-result title="Example exchange performing resource lookup"}

This is not *literally* the same response that it would have received from a
multicast request, but it contains the equivalent statement:

'`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]` is hosting the resource
`coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp`, which is of the resource type "temperature" and
can be accessed using the text/plain content format.'

To complete the examples, the client could also query all resources hosted at
the endpoint with the known endpoint name "simple-host1":

~~~~
Req: GET coap://[2001:db8:f0::ff]/rd-lookup/res?ep=simple-host1

Res: 2.05 Content
Payload:
<coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp>;rt=temperature;ct=0,
<coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/light>;rt=light-lux;ct=0,
<coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/t>;
    anchor="coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp";rel=alternate,
<http://www.example.com/sensors/t123>;
    anchor="coap://[2001:db8:f0::1]/sensors/temp";rel=describedby
~~~~
{: #example-weblink-lookup-result-extended title="Extended example exchange performing resource lookup "}

All the target and anchor references are already in absolute form there, which
don't need to be resolved any further.

Had the simple host done an equivalent full registration with a base= parameter (e.g.
`?ep=simple-host1&base=coap+tcp://simple-host1.example.com`), that context would
have been used to resolve the relative anchor values instead, giving

~~~~
<coap+tcp://simple-host1.example.com/sensors/temp>;rt=temperature;ct=0
~~~~
{: #example-weblink-lookup-result-base title="Example payload of a response to a resource lookup with a dedicated base URI"}

and analogous records.

## A note on differences between link-format and Link header fields {#resolution-rules}

While link-format and Link header fields look very similar and are based on the same
model of typed links, there are some differences between {{RFC6690}} and
{{RFC8288}}.
When implementing an RD or interacting with an RD,
care must be taken to follow the {{RFC6690}} behavior
whenever application/link-format representations are used.

* "Default value of anchor":
  Both under {{RFC6690}} and {{RFC8288}},
  relative references in the term inside the angle brackets (the target)
  and the anchor attribute are resolved against the relevant base URI
  (which usually is the URI used to retrieve the entity),
  and independent of each other.

  When, in an {{RFC8288}} Link header, the anchor attribute is absent,
  the link's context is the URI of the selected representation
  (and usually equal to the base URI).

  In {{RFC6690}} links, if the anchor attribute is absent,
  the default value is the Origin of
  (for all relevant cases: the URI reference `/` resolved against)
  the link's target.

* There is no percent encoding in link-format documents.

  A link-format document is a UTF-8 encoded string of Unicode characters and
  does not have percent encoding, while Link header fields are practically ASCII
  strings that use percent encoding for non-ASCII characters, stating the
  encoding explicitly when required.

  For example, while a Link header field in a page about a Swedish city might read

  ~~~~
  Link: </temperature/Malm%C3%B6>;rel=live-environment-data
  ~~~~

  a link-format document from the same source might describe the link as

  ~~~~
  </temperature/Malmö>;rel=live-environment-data
  ~~~~

# Limited Link Format {#limitedlinkformat}

The CoRE Link Format as described in {{RFC6690}}
has been interpreted differently by implementers,
and a strict implementation
rules out some use cases of an RD
(e.g. base values with path components in combination with absent anchors).

This appendix describes
a subset of link format documents called Limited Link Format.
The one rule herein is not very limiting in practice --
all examples in RFC6690, and all deployments the authors are aware of already stick to them --
but ease the implementation of RD servers.

It is applicable to representations in the application/link-format media type,
and any other media types that inherit {{RFC6690}} Section 2.1.

A link format representation is in Limited Link format if,
for each link in it,
the following applies:

All URI references either follow the URI or the path-absolute ABNF rule of
  RFC3986 (i.e. target and anchor each either start with a scheme or with a
  single slash).
